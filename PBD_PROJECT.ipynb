       "  'In Ginsberg\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\x80\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\n',\n",

       "  'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\n',\n",

       "  'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\n',\n",

       "  'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\n',\n",

There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch.

At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\n',\n",

       "  'Ginsberg\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends.

       "  '====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\x80\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\x80\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\x80\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\x80\\x9cangry fixâ\\x80\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\x80\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\x80\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\x80\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\x80\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\x80\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\x80\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\n',\n",

Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\x80\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay. He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in 1962.

A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader.

He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.

Addressing speculations that he was Allen Ginsberg\\'s guru, Bhaktivedanta Swami answered a direct question in a public program, \"Are you Allen Ginsberg\\'s guru?\" by saying, \"I am nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s guru. I am everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s servant.

It featured some leading rock bands of the time: Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and Moby Grape, who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. \\n',\n",

In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing \"Howl\". At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in \"Howl\" was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law. Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California Press (2004). Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem\\'s depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including Lady Chatterleyâ\\x80\\x99s Lover. The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even long time lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex, and used this to comment on the emptiness and constant hunger that could exist in the lives of Americans. For example, in \"Howl\", Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls\". Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled \"Howl\" eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues. Ginsberg\\'s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance\", Ed. Bill Morgan. \"Howl\" on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression. California: City of Lights (2006). thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970-1996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with PEN American Center with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to Herbert Huncke: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.

Though he took odd jobs to support himself, in 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry. Soon after, he wrote \"Howl\", the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life.

       "  'Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac\\'s concept of \"spontaneous prose\". He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of \"Howl\" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg\\'s insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry. \\n',\n",

       "  'The inspiration for \"Howl\" was Ginsberg\\'s friend, Carl Solomon, and \"Howl\" is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem). Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of therapy, including electroshock therapy. Much of the final section of the first part of \"Howl\" is a description of this.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \"Moloch\". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg\\'s heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg\\'s Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang\\'s film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. See, for example, Allen Ginsberg, Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions, ed. Barry Miles (New York: Harper, 1986), 139â\\x80\\x93140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of \"Howl\", which can be seen in the cited pages. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of postâ\\x80\\x93World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to defy socially created systems of controlâ\\x80\\x94and therefore go against Molochâ\\x80\\x94is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in \"Howl\", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of \"Howl\" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg\\'s schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally ****** (fucked)\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write \"Howl\" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959\\'s \"Kaddish\", which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with Thomas Merton. \\n',\n",

He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams\\' own motto \"No ideas but in things.\" Studying Williams\\' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include Bricklayer\\'s Lunch Hour and Dream Record. \\n',\n",

       "  'Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (To Have Done with the Judgement of God and Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society), and Jean Genet (Our Lady of the Flowers). Philip Lamantia introduced him to other Surrealists and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of \"Kaddish\" were inspired by AndrÃ© Breton\\'s Free Union). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of \"Howl\" and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as Jubilate Agno. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: Franz Kafka, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Edgar Allan Poe, and even Emily Dickinson. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul CÃ©zanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the Eyeball Kick. He noticed in viewing CÃ©zanne\\'s paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg\\'s poems). Another example is Ginsberg\\'s observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan\\'s hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and psychedelics, as a Dexedrine Clown. The phrases \"eyeball kick\" and \"hydrogen jukebox\" both show up in \"Howl\", as well as a direct quote from CÃ©zanne: \"Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus\". \\n',\n",

       "  'From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friendsâ\\x80\\x94not to mention his own experimentsâ\\x80\\x94Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that\\'s easily identified as Ginsbergian. TV interview 1982 Hedwig Gorski and Robert Creeley discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry. Special Robert Creeley issue, Turkey. \"Howl\" came out during a potentially hostile literary environment, less welcoming to non-traditional, free verse poetry; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by New Criticism. Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long, free verse lines, often citing Whitman\\'s free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor. Ginsberg claimed Whitman\\'s long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality. Though some critics, like Diana Trilling, have pointed to Ginsberg\\'s occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of \"who came back to Denver and waited in vain\"), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the \"natural\" poetic voice. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg\\'s line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in \"Howl\", for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Many of Ginsberg\\'s early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora, repetition of a \"fixed base\" (for example \"who\" in \"Howl\", \"America\" in America) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg\\'s style. He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust \"free flight\". In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of \"Kaddish\" (\"caw\" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of \"Howl\", each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams. But he abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America. \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\", arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In America, he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines. \\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'In \"Howl\" and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic, free verse style of the 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman. see Ginsberg, (Deliberate Prose), pp. 285â\\x80\\x93331. Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence. J. D. McClatchy, editor of the Yale Review, called Ginsberg \"the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.\" McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, \"was a bard in the old manner â\\x80\\x93 outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era\\'s psyche, with all its contradictory urges.\" \\n',\n",

       "  \"Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov, PhD (, Anatolij Evgen'eviÄ\\x8d Karpov; born May 23, 1951) is a Russian chess grandmaster and former World Champion. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes. However, in his 1994 book \"My Best Games\" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100. He had a peak Elo rating of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is second all-time behind only Garry Kasparov since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.\\n',\n",

       "  '==Early life==\\n',\n",
       "  'Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at Zlatoust in the Urals region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik\\'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: \"The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there\\'s no future at all for him in this profession.\" Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik\\'s tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by Boris Spassky in 1952.\\n',\n",

In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at Groningen. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered Moscow State University in 1968 to study mathematics. He later transferred to Leningrad State University, eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster Semyon Furman, who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the World Junior Chess Championship, scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at Stockholm. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in Caracas, Venezuela, and was awarded the grandmaster title.\\n',\n",

His Elo rating shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the USSR Chess Championship, and finished equal first with Viktor Korchnoi in the Leningrad Interzonal Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 Candidates Matches, which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, Bobby Fischer.\\n',\n",

He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism and sexual repression. Ginsberg is best known for his epic poem \"Howl\", in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States.

The trip deeply disturbed Ginsberg â\\\\x80\\\\x93 he mentioned it and other moments from his childhood in \"Kaddish\". His experiences with his mother\\\\\\'s mental illness and her institutionalization are also frequently referred to in \"Howl\". For example, \"Pilgrim State, Rockland, and Grey Stone\\\\\\'s foetid halls\" is a reference to institutions frequented by his mother and Carl Solomon, ostensibly the subject of the poem: Pilgrim State Hospital and Rockland State Hospital in New York and Greystone State Hospital in New Jersey.

This is followed soon by the line \"with mother finally ******.\" Ginsberg later admitted the deletion was the expletive \"fucked.\" Original Draft p. 131. He also says of Solomon in section three, \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother,\" once again showing the association between Solomon and his mother. Jonah Raskin, American Scream: Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation, pp. 156â\\\\x80\\\\x93157. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg received a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of \"Howl\" he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, \"The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window â\\\\x80\\\\x93 I have the key â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Get married Allen don\\\\\\'t take drugs â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window\". Hyde, pp. 426â\\\\x80\\\\x93427. In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s brother Eugene, she said, \"God\\\\\\'s informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key on the side of the window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window.\" Morgan, Celebrate, pp. 219â\\\\x80\\\\x93220. These letters and the inability to perform the kaddish ceremony inspired Ginsberg to write \"Kaddish\" which makes references to many details from Naomi\\\\\\'s life, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines \"the key is in the light\" and \"the key is in the window\". Allen Ginsberg. Kaddish and Other Poems. Volume 2, Issue 14 of The Pocket Poets series. City Lights Books, 1961. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===New York Beats===\\\\n\\', \\'In Ginsberg\\\\\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\\\\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\\\\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\\\\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\\\\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The Blake Vision===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===San Francisco Renaissance===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky (1933â\\\\x80\\\\x932010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg\\'s mentor William Carlos Williams wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead Kenneth Rexroth, who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, Bob Kaufman, A. D. Winans, and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazine.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Wally Hedrick â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery â\\\\x80\\\\x93 approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\\\\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\\\\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends. Ball, Gordon, \"\\\\\\'Howl\\\\\\' and Other Victories: A friend remembers City Lights\\\\\\' Shig Murao,\" San Francisco Chronicle, 11/28/99. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\\\\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cangry fixâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\\\x80\\\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\\\x80\\\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===To Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\"===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in Morocco, he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\\\x80\\\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay. He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in 1962. Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably Pupul Jayakar who helped him escape imprisonment during the Sino-Indian War.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===England and the International Poetry Incarnation===\\\\n\\', \\'In May 1965, Allen Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free. Nuttall, J: Bomb Culture MacGibbon & Kee, 1968 ISBN 0-261-62617-5 Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at Better Books, which was described by Jeff Nuttall as \"the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind\". Tom McGrath wrote \"This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or at least in the history of English Poetry\". Fountain, N: Underground: the London alternative press, 1966â\\\\x80\\\\x9374 page 16. Taylor & Francis, 1988 ISBN 0-415-00728-3 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the International Poetry Incarnation, which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 11, 1965. The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, Adrian Mitchell, Alexander Trocchi, Harry Fainlight, Anselm Hollo, Christopher Logue, George Macbeth, Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael Horovitz, Simon Vinkenoog, Spike Hawkins and Tom McGrath.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Peter Whitehead documented the event on film and released it as Wholly Communion. A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Continuing literary activity===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg with his partner, poet Peter Orlovsky. Photo taken in 1978\\\\n\\', \\'Though the term \"Beat\" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term \"Beat Generation\" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: David Amram, Bob Kaufman; LeRoi Jones before he became Amiri Baraka, who, after reading \"Howl\", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper; Diane DiPrima; Jim Cohn; poets associated with the Black Mountain College such as Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov; poets associated with the New York School such as Frank O\\\\\\'Hara and Kenneth Koch.\\\\n\\', \\'Portrait with Bob Dylan, taken in 1975\\\\n\\', \\'Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the beat movement of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s, befriending, among others, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, and Bob Dylan. Ginsberg gave his last public reading at Booksmith, a bookstore in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, a few months before his death. Video of Ginsberg biographer Bill Morgan speaking about the poet. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Buddhism and Krishnaism===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to India. A chance encounter on a New York City street with ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche (they both tried to catch the same cab), a Kagyu and Nyingma Tibetan Buddhist master, led to Trungpa becoming his friend and lifelong teacher . Ginsberg helped Trungpa (and New York poet Anne Waldman) in founding the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. \"The Beats and Travel\" by David S. Wills \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was also involved with Krishnaism. He had started incorporating chanting the Hare Krishna mantra into his religious practice in the mid sixties. After learning that A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in the Western world had rented a store front in New York, he befriended him, visiting him often and suggesting publishers for his books, and a fruitful relationship began. This relationship is documented by Satsvarupa Das Goswami in his biographical account Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta. Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and toured with him to promote his cause. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s greeting Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport. January 17, 1967Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami\\\\\\'s required prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community. (from the \"Houseboat Summit\" panel discussion, Sausalito CA. February 1967)():\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg: So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?\\\\n\\', \"Snyder: Why, it\\'s a lovely positive thing to say Krishna.

In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing \"Howl\". At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in \"Howl\" was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law. Raskin, Jonah. American Scream:Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation. California: University of California Press (2004). Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem\\\\\\'s depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including Lady Chatterleyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s Lover. The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even long time lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed casual sex, and used this to comment on the emptiness and constant hunger that could exist in the lives of Americans. For example, in \"Howl\", Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls\". Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled \"Howl\" eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues. Ginsberg\\\\\\'s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance\", Ed. Bill Morgan. \"Howl\" on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression. California: City of Lights (2006). thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970-1996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with PEN American Center with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to Herbert Huncke: he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help.

Raskin, 170. On the other hand, when Donald Manes, a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the Communist Party, Ginsberg objected: \"I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the Communist party, nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of U.S. government or any government by violence....

He claimed that communist countries, such as China, welcomed him because they thought he was an enemy of capitalism, but often turned against him when they saw him as a trouble maker.

VÃ¡clav Havel points to Ginsberg as an important inspiration in striving for freedom. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Gay rights===\\\\n\\', \\'One contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about homosexuality. Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people. In 1943, he discovered within himself \"mountains of homosexuality.\" He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry. He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his Who\\\\\\'s Who entry. Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent, he challengedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and ultimately changedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94obscenity laws. He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws (William S. Burroughs and Lenny Bruce, for example).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Association with NAMBLA===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was a supporter and member of North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). In \"Thoughts on NAMBLA\", a 1994 essay published in the collection Deliberate Prose, Ginsberg stated, \"I joined NAMBLA in defense of free speech.\" He referred to NAMBLA \"as a forum for reform of those laws on youthful sexuality which members deem oppressive, a discussion society not a sex club.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Demystification of drugs===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg also talked often about drug use. Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of LSD, and, with Timothy Leary, worked to promote its common use. He was also for many decades an advocate of marijuana legalization, and, at the same time, warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Don\\\\\\'t Smoke): \"Don\\\\\\'t Smoke Don\\\\\\'t Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No / No don\\\\\\'t smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=== CIA drug trafficking===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Through his own drug use, and the drug use of his friends and associates, Ginsberg became more and more preoccupied with the American government\\\\\\'s relationship to drug use within and outside the nation. He worked closely with Alfred W. McCoy who was writing The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia which tracked the history of the American government\\\\\\'s involvement in illegal opium dealing around the world. This would affirm Ginsberg\\\\\\'s suspicions that the government and the CIA were involved in drug trafficking. In addition to working with McCoy, Ginsberg personally confronted Richard Helms, the director of the CIA in the 1970s, but he was simply brushed off as being \"full of beans\". Allen wrote many essays and articles, researching and compiling evidence of CIA\\\\\\'s involvement, but it would take ten years, and the publication of McCoy\\\\\\'s book in 1972, before anyone took him seriously. In 1978 Allen received a note from the chief editor of the New York Times, apologizing for not taking his allegations seriously so many years previous. I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin, 2006. ISBN 978-0-14-311249-5, p. 470-477. The political subject is dealt with in the song/poem \"CIA Dope calypso\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Work==\\\\n\\', \\'Though early on Ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer, he wrote poetry for most of his life. Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol William Blake. His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously. Though he took odd jobs to support himself, in 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry. Soon after, he wrote \"Howl\", the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life. Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at Brooklyn College from 1986 until his death.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inspiration from friends===\\\\n\\', \"Since Ginsberg\\'s poetry is intensely personal, and since much of the vitality of those associated with the beat generation comes from mutual inspiration, much credit for style, inspiration, and content can be given to Ginsberg\\'s friends.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac\\\\\\'s concept of \"spontaneous prose\". He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of \"Howl\" he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsberg\\\\\\'s insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The inspiration for \"Howl\" was Ginsberg\\\\\\'s friend, Carl Solomon, and \"Howl\" is dedicated to Solomon (whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem). Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud) who suffered bouts of depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy. The institution refused, giving him many forms of therapy, including electroshock therapy. Much of the final section of the first part of \"Howl\" is a description of this.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \"Moloch\". Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a Levantine god to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s heroes, Dylan Thomas. Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s Jewish background are not infrequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang\\\\\\'s film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward. See, for example, Allen Ginsberg, Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript & Variant Versions, ed. Barry Miles (New York: Harper, 1986), 139â\\\\x80\\\\x93140. Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of \"Howl\", which can be seen in the cited pages. Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us: the decision to defy socially created systems of controlâ\\\\x80\\\\x94and therefore go against Molochâ\\\\x80\\\\x94is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in \"Howl\", such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of \"Howl\" are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg\\\\\\'s schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally ****** (fucked)\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write \"Howl\" was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959\\\\\\'s \"Kaddish\", which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with Thomas Merton. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inspiration from mentors and idols===\\\\n\\', \"Ginsberg\\'s poetry was strongly influenced by Modernism (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), Romanticism (specifically William Blake and John Keats), the beat and cadence of jazz (specifically that of bop musicians such as Charlie Parker), and his Kagyu Buddhist practice and Jewish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca. The power of Ginsberg\\'s verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed. Ginsberg, Allen. Spontaneous Mind: Selected Interviews, 1958â\\\\x80\\\\x931996. Harper Perennial, 2002. ISBN 0-06-093082-9 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He corresponded with William Carlos Williams, who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem Paterson about the industrial city near his home. After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like \"thee.\" Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg, \"In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Though he disliked these early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s letter. He included the letter in a later part of Paterson. He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams\\\\\\' own motto \"No ideas but in things.\" Studying Williams\\\\\\' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial free verse style. Early breakthrough poems include Bricklayer\\\\\\'s Lunch Hour and Dream Record. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud (To Have Done with the Judgement of God and Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society), and Jean Genet (Our Lady of the Flowers). Philip Lamantia introduced him to other Surrealists and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of \"Kaddish\" were inspired by AndrÃ© Breton\\\\\\'s Free Union). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of \"Howl\" and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as Jubilate Agno. Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as: Franz Kafka, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Edgar Allan Poe, and even Emily Dickinson. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul CÃ©zanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the Eyeball Kick. He noticed in viewing CÃ©zanne\\\\\\'s paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s poems). Another example is Ginsberg\\\\\\'s observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan\\\\\\'s hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and psychedelics, as a Dexedrine Clown. The phrases \"eyeball kick\" and \"hydrogen jukebox\" both show up in \"Howl\", as well as a direct quote from CÃ©zanne: \"Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus\". \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Style and technique===\\\\n\\', \\'From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friendsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94not to mention his own experimentsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that\\\\\\'s easily identified as Ginsbergian. TV interview 1982 Hedwig Gorski and Robert Creeley discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry. Special Robert Creeley issue, Turkey. \"Howl\" came out during a potentially hostile literary environment, less welcoming to non-traditional, free verse poetry; there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by New Criticism. Consequently, Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long, free verse lines, often citing Whitman\\\\\\'s free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor. Ginsberg claimed Whitman\\\\\\'s long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality. Though some critics, like Diana Trilling, have pointed to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s occasional use of meter (for example the anapest of \"who came back to Denver and waited in vain\"), Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the \"natural\" poetic voice. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally. Like Williams, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s line breaks were often determined by breath: one line in \"Howl\", for example, should be read in one breath. Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Many of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora, repetition of a \"fixed base\" (for example \"who\" in \"Howl\", \"America\" in America) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s style. He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust \"free flight\". In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of \"Kaddish\" (\"caw\" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of \"Howl\", each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams. But he abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America. \"Howl\" and \"Kaddish\", arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In America, he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In \"Howl\" and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic, free verse style of the 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman. see Ginsberg, (Deliberate Prose), pp. 285â\\\\x80\\\\x93331. Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence. J. D. McClatchy, editor of the Yale Review, called Ginsberg \"the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.\" McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, \"was a bard in the old manner â\\\\x80\\\\x93 outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era\\\\\\'s psyche, with all its contradictory urges.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Bibliography==\\\\n\\', \\'right\\\\n\\', \\'* Howl and Other Poems (1956) ISBN 978-0-87286-017-9\\\\n\\', \\'* Kaddish and Other Poems (1961) ISBN 978-0-87286-019-3\\\\n\\', \\'* (1961)\\\\n\\', \\'* Reality Sandwiches (1963) ISBN 978-0-87286-021-6\\\\n\\', \\'* The Yage Letters (1963) â\\\\x80\\\\x93 with William S.

The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed. Also, no finite field F is algebraically closed, because if a1, a2, â\\\\x80¦, an are the elements of F, then the polynomial (x &minus; a1)(x &minus; a2) Â·Â·Â· (x &minus; a\\'n) + 1\\\\n\", \\'has no zero in F. By contrast, the fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) algebraic numbers.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Equivalent properties==\\\\n\\', \\'Given a field F, the assertion â\\\\x80\\\\x9cF is algebraically closedâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is equivalent to other assertions:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if the only irreducible polynomials in the polynomial ring F are those of degree one.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The assertion â\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe polynomials of degree one are irreducibleâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is trivially true for any field. If F is algebraically closed and p(x) is an irreducible polynomial of F, then it has some root a and therefore p(x) is a multiple of x &minus; a. Since p(x) is irreducible, this means that p(x) = k(x &minus; a), for some k â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F \\\\\\\\ {0}. On the other hand, if F is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial p(x) in F without roots in F. Let q(x) be some irreducible factor of p(x). Since p(x) has no roots in F, q(x) also has no roots in F. Therefore, q(x) has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in F.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial p(x) of degree n â\\\\x89¥ 1, with coefficients in F, splits into linear factors. In other words, there are elements k, x1, x2, â\\\\x80¦, xn of the field F such that p(x) = k(x &minus; x1)(x &minus; x2) Â·Â·Â· (x &minus; xn).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in F has some root in F; in other words, F is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for F if F is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field K, any polynomial in K can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Polynomials of prime degree have roots===\\\\n\\', \\'J. Shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F, then every non-constant polynomial has a root in F, thus F is algebraically closed.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The field has no proper algebraic extension===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extension.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F has no proper algebraic extension, let p(x) be some irreducible polynomial in F. Then the quotient of F modulo the ideal generated by p(x) is an algebraic extension of F whose degree is equal to the degree of p(x). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of p(x) is 1.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On the other hand, if F has some proper algebraic extension K, then the minimal polynomial of an element in K \\\\\\\\ F is irreducible and its degree is greater than 1.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The field has no proper finite extension===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite algebraic extension because if, within the previous proof, the word â\\\\x80\\\\x9calgebraicâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d is replaced by the word â\\\\x80\\\\x9cfiniteâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, then the proof is still valid.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number n, every linear map from Fn into itself has some eigenvector.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"An endomorphism of Fn has an eigenvector if and only if its characteristic polynomial has some root. Therefore, when F is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of Fn has an eigenvector, let p(x) be an element of F. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial q(x) which has roots if and only if p(x) has roots. But if q(x) = xn + a\\'n &minus; 1x\\'n &minus; 1+ Â·Â·Â· + a0, then q(x) is the characteristic polynomial of the companion matrix\\\\n\", \\':\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Decomposition of rational expressions===\\\\n\\', \\'The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every rational function in one variable x, with coefficients in F, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form a/(x &minus; b)n, where n is a natural number, and a and b are elements of F.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in F are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the theorem on partial fraction decomposition.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field F. Let p(x) be an irreducible element in F. Then the rational function 1/p can be written as the sum of a polynomial function q with rational functions of the form a/(x &minus; b)n. Therefore, the rational expression\\\\n\\', \\':\\\\n\\', \\'can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since p(x) is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Relatively prime polynomials and roots===\\\\n\\', \\'For any field F, if two polynomials p(x),q(x) â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F are relatively prime then they do not have a common root, for if a â\\\\x88\\\\x88 F was a common root, then p(x) and q(x) would both be multiples of x &minus; a and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If the field F is algebraically closed, let p(x) and q(x) be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let r(x) be their greatest common divisor. Then, since r(x) is not constant, it will have some root a, which will be then a common root of p(x) and q(x).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If F is not algebraically closed, let p(x) be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then p(x) and p(x) are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Other properties==\\\\n\\', \\'If F is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number, then F contains all nth roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the n (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial xn &minus; 1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension, and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form xn &minus; a splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of first-order logic is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same characteristic. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic 0, but there is some natural number N such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic p when p &gt; N.

He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE\\'s new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world\\'s elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes. However, in his 1994 book \"My Best Games\" Karpov says he played some 200 tournaments and matches, and won more than 100. He had a peak Elo rating of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is second all-time behind only Garry Kasparov since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since 2005, he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of iodised salt. Unicef website On December 17, 2012, Karpov supported http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/79982 the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Early life==\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at Zlatoust in the Urals region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of four. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik\\\\\\'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: \"The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there\\\\\\'s no future at all for him in this profession.\" Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik\\\\\\'s tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by Boris Spassky in 1952.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==International career==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Young master===\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in TÅ\\\\x99inec several months later, ahead of Viktor Kupreichik. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at Groningen. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered Moscow State University in 1968 to study mathematics. He later transferred to Leningrad State University, eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster Semyon Furman, who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the World Junior Chess Championship, scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at Stockholm. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in Caracas, Venezuela, and was awarded the grandmaster title.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Top-Class Grandmaster===\\\\n\\', \\'He won the 1971 Alekhine Memorial in Moscow (equal with Leonid Stein), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His Elo rating shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the USSR Chess Championship, and finished equal first with Viktor Korchnoi in the Leningrad Interzonal Tournament, with the latter success qualifying him for the 1974 Candidates Matches, which would determine the challenger of the reigning world champion, Bobby Fischer.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Candidate===\\\\n\\', \"Karpov defeated Lev Polugaevsky by the score of +3 =5 in the first Candidates\\' match, earning the right to face former champion Boris Spassky in the semifinal round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates\\' cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates\\' cycle in 1977.\\\\n\", \\'Spassky won the first game as Black in good style, but tenacious, aggressive play from Karpov secured him overall victory by +4 â\\\\x88\\\\x921 =6.\\\\n\\', \"The Candidates\\' final was played in Moscow with Korchnoi. Karpov took an early lead, winning the second game against the Sicilian Dragon, then scoring another victory in the sixth game. Following ten consecutive draws, Korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Karpov a 3â\\\\x80\\\\x930 lead. In game 19, Korchnoi succeeded in winning a long endgame, then notched a speedy victory after a blunder by Karpov two games later. Three more draws, the last agreed by Karpov in a clearly better position, closed the match, as he thus prevailed +3 â\\\\x88\\\\x922 =19, moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Match with Fischer in 1975===\\\\n\\', \"Though a world championship match between Karpov and Fischer was highly anticipated, those hopes were never realised. Fischer insisted that the match be the first to ten wins (draws not counting), but that the champion would retain the crown if the score was tied 9â\\\\x80\\\\x939. FIDE, the International Chess Federation, refused to allow this proviso, and after Fischer\\'s resignation of the championship on June 27, 1974, FIDE declared that Fischer forfeited his crown. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.\\\\n\", \\'Garry Kasparov argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years. Kasparov, My Great Predecessors, part IV: Fischer, p. 474 Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978. In an article (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website Susan Polgar wrote: \"I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===World champion===\\\\n\\', \\'Determined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He convincingly won the very strong Milan tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (nine) until it was shattered by Garry Kasparov (14).\\\\n\\', \"In 1978, Karpov\\'s first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 1973â\\\\x80\\\\x9375 Candidates\\' cycle; the match was played at Baguio, Philippines, with the winner needing six victories.\\\\n\", \"As in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match, but Korchnoi staged a comeback late in the match, as, after the score was +5 â\\\\x88\\\\x922 =20 in Karpov\\'s favour, he won three of the next four games to draw level, with Karpov then winning the next game to retain the title (+6 â\\\\x88\\\\x925 =21).\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Three years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates\\\\\\' winner against German finalist Dr. Robert HÃ¼bner to challenge Karpov in Merano, Italy. This match, however, was won handily by Karpov, the score being (11&ndash;7, +6 â\\\\x88\\\\x922 =10) in what is remembered as the \"Massacre in Merano\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov\\\\\\'s tournament career reached a peak at the Montreal \"Tournament of Stars\" tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7 â\\\\x88\\\\x921 =10) with Mikhail Tal, ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by Jan Timman, Ljubomir LjubojeviÄ\\\\x87, Spassky, Vlastimil Hort, Lajos Portisch, Huebner, Bent Larsen and Lubomir Kavalek. He dominated Las Palmas 1977 with 13Â½/15. He also won the prestigious Bugojno tournament in 1978 (shared) and 1980, the Linares tournament in 1981 (shared with Larry Christiansen) and 1994, the Tilburg tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the Soviet Championship in 1976, 1983, and 1988.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov represented the Soviet Union at six Chess Olympiads, in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal. He played first reserve at Skopje 1972, winning the board prize with 13/15. At Nice 1974, he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12/14. At La Valletta 1980, he was again board one and scored 9/12. At Lucerne 1982, he scored 6Â½/8 on board one. At Dubai 1986, he scored 6/9 on board two. His last was Thessaloniki 1988, where on board two he scored 8/10. In Olympiad play, Karpov lost only two games out of 68 played.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"To illustrate Karpov\\'s dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11 â\\\\x88\\\\x922 =20 versus Spassky, +5 =12 versus Robert HÃ¼bner, +6 â\\\\x88\\\\x921 =16 versus Ulf Andersson, +3 â\\\\x88\\\\x921 =10 versus Vasily Smyslov, +1 =16 versus Mikhail Tal, +10 â\\\\x88\\\\x922 =13 versus LjubojeviÄ\\\\x87.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"Karpov had cemented his position as the world\\'s best player and world champion by the time Garry Kasparov arrived on the scene. In their first match, the World Chess Championship 1984, held in Moscow, with the victor again being the first to win six games outright, Karpov built a 4â\\\\x80\\\\x930 lead after nine games. The next seventeen games were drawn, setting the record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which fourteen more draws ensued. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won games 47 and 48, FIDE President Florencio Campomanes unilaterally terminated the match, citing the health of the players. 1984 Karpovâ\\\\x80\\\\x93Kasparov Title Match Highlights Mark Weeks\\' Chess Pages The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and forty draws.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'A rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 12â\\\\x80\\\\x9312). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but wound up losing, thus surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 13-11 (+3 â\\\\x88\\\\x925 =16), in favour of Kasparov.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Rivalry with Kasparov===\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world #2) until the early 1990s. He fought Kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 (held in London and Leningrad), 1987 (held in Seville), and 1990 (held in New York City and Lyon). All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11Â½ to 12Â½ (+4 â\\\\x88\\\\x925 =15), 12 to 12 (+4 â\\\\x88\\\\x924 =16), and 11Â½ to 12Â½ (+3 â\\\\x88\\\\x924 =17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov is on record saying that if he had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he could have been a much better player as a result.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===FIDE champion again (1993â\\\\x80\\\\x9399)===\\\\n\\', \\'Karpov in 1996\\\\n\\', \"In 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against Nigel Short.

Karpov defeated Timman â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the loser of the Candidates\\' final against Short.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"The next major meeting of Kasparov and Karpov was the 1994 Linares chess tournament. The field, in eventual finishing order, was Karpov, Kasparov, Shirov, Bareev, Kramnik, Lautier, Anand, Kamsky, Topalov, Ivanchuk, Gelfand, Illescas, Judit PolgÃ¡r, and Beliavsky; with an average Elo rating of 2685, the highest ever at that time, making it the first Category XVIII tournament ever held. Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won San Remo in 1930), finishing 2Â½ points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov is considered possibly the finest of his career). This performance against the best players in the world put his Elo rating tournament performance at 2985, the highest performance rating of any player in history up until 2009, when Magnus Carlsen won the category XXI Pearl Spring chess tournament with a performance of 3002.

NASCAR was founded by William France, Sr., on February 21, 1948, with the help of several other drivers of the time. The first NASCAR \"Strictly Stock\" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at Daytona Beach, Florida.

NASCAR\\\\\\'s Strictly Stock Division was renamed the \"Grand National\" division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose-built race cars with a stock-appearing body.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'From 1962 sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.

The combination of mostly British chassis and American V8 engines gave rise to the Can-Am series in the 1960s and 1970s. This series, based in the United States and Canada, featured lightweight prototype sports cars fitted with large, powerful production-based engines that produced speeds in excess of 200 mph. Clubmans provided much entertainment at club-racing level from the 1960s into the 1990s and John Webb revived interest in big sports prototypes with Thundersports in the 1980s. Group 4 Grand Touring Cars and Group 5 Special Production Cars became the premier form of Sports car racing from 1976, with prototypes going into a general decline apart from Porsche 936 domination at Le Mans and a lower-key series of races for smaller two-litre Group 6 prototypes. The last NASCAR race on a dirt track was held on September 30, 1970 at the half-mile State Fairgrounds Speedway in Raleigh, North Carolina. From 1972 through 2003, NASCAR\\\\\\'s premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston.

In the USA, the IMSA Camel GTP series boasted close competition between huge fields of manufacturer-backed teams and privateer squads â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the cars were technically similar to Group Cs but used a sliding scale of weights and engine capacities to try to limit performance. The FIA attempted to make Group C into a virtual \"two seater Grand Prix\" format in the early 1990s, with engine rules in common with F1, short race distances, and a schedule dovetailing with that of the F1 rounds. The IMSA GT Championship had been prototype-based since 1983, with less emphasis on production cars. Australian Production Car Championship was first contested in 1987, with the inaugural champion determined from the results of two races held at the Winton Motor Raceway in Victoria on September 27. The first World Touring Car Championship, which was open to Group A Touring Cars, was held in 1987 concurrent to the long-running European Touring Car Championship (ETCC). Additional rounds were held outside Europe at Bathurst in Australia, Calder Park Raceway in Australia (using both the road course and the then newly constructed Thunderdome), Wellington in New Zealand and Mount Fuji in Japan. The Drivers Championship was won by Roberto Ravaglia in a BMW M3 and the Entrants Championship was won by the Eggenberger Texaco Ford No 7 entry, which was a Ford Sierra.

This coincided with a decline of popularity in American Championship Car Racing. The FISA decided to separate the rally cars into three classes: Group N (production cars), Group A (modified production cars), and Group B (modified sport cars).

Cars compete on closed public roads or off-road areas run on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers \"rally\" to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of \"special stages\" on any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as \"pace notes.\" During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event\\\\\\'s special stages, including penalties.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The top series is the World Rally Championship (WRC), but there also regional championships and many countries have their own national championships.

The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built dragster. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the Â¼ mile in 12 to 16 seconds, whereas a top fuel dragster takes 4.5 seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to 530 km/h.

Ingels, and everyone else who drove the kart, were startled at its performance capabilities. The sport soon blossomed in Southern California, and quickly spread around the world. Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, kart racing, or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso.

Edward Stringham, Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice, p 51 In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through compulsory taxation. Money, along with all other goods and services, would be privately and competitively provided in an open market.

However, they also recognize charity and communal arrangements as part of the same voluntary ethic. Hess, Karl. The Death of Politics. Interview in Playboy Magazine, March 1969 Though anarcho-capitalists are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some propose that non-state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho-capitalist society. For them, what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from the compulsory state. Anarcho-capitalist libertarians believe that the only just, and/or most economically beneficial, way to acquire property is through voluntary trade, gift, or labor-based original appropriation, rather than through aggression or fraud.

Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e., a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal. Rothbard, Murray N.

Retrieved 20 May 2005 The initiation of force is usually referred to as aggression or coercion. The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. Minarchist libertarians, such as most people involved in libertarian political parties, would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military; others, however, might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of state intervention, defining the state as a coercive monopoly and, as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression, an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Some anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the nonaggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis. It is in terms of the non-aggression principle that Rothbard defined anarchism; he defined \"anarchism as a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression person and property\\\\\\'\" and said that \"what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion.\" Rothbard, Murray N.

As Rothbard says, \"if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made.\" After property is transformed through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift; forced transfers are considered illegitimate. Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land, and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same \"absolute right\" as his own body. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it; it is only by using land â\\\\x80\\\\x93 by mixing one\\\\\\'s labor with it â\\\\x80\\\\x93 that original appropriation is legitimized: \"Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.\" Rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the person\\\\\\'s property, \"for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns\\\\\\' in perpetuity.\" Rothbard, Murray N.

Rothbard says,\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Rothbard says in \"Justice and Property Right\" that \"any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property.\" In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases \"the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed.\" He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the \"homestead principle\". If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector: \"any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible.\" For example, he proposes that State universities be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally \"private property\" if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers. He says, \"What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not \"private\" property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property.\" Likewise, Karl Hess says, \"libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private...Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system.\" Hess, Karl (1969) Letter From Washington The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006 By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=====Intellectual property=====\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The issue of intellectual property is polarizing among anarcho-capitalists as with libertarians in general, but anarcho-capitalists tend to be against intellectual property. Rothbard argues that patents are coercive monopolistic privileges granted by the state, and says they would not exist in a free society, because they prohibit individuals from independently coming up with the same invention. He also argued that copyrights are in some situations compatible with a free society. His argument is that when a copyright notice is on a piece of literary work this is a signal that the creator of the work does not consent to anyone to using it unless they agree not to copy it, hence if it is used this constitutes a contract.

Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers, and portions of oceans. Holcombe, Randall G., Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism, Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 19, No. 2 (Spring 2005):3â\\\\x80\\\\x9329. Anarcho-capitalist theorist Roderick Long gives the following example:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Nevertheless, since property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership to the extent of the number of owners â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely, anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional communal arrangements. Privatization, decentralization, and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. But in some cases, they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Anarcho-capitalists tend to concur with free-market environmentalists regarding the environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements. Air, water, and land pollution, for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. Central governments generally strike down individual or class action censure of polluters in order to benefit \"the many\", and legal or economic subsidy of heavy industry is justified by many politicians for job creation within a political territory. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Contractual society===\\\\n\\', \"A postage stamp celebrating the thousandth anniversary of the Icelandic parliament.

It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'One particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer insurance and death benefits to same-sex couples; another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Rothbard points out that corporations would exist in a free society, as they are simply the pooling of capital. He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: \"Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation....\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Corporations created in this way would not, however, be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that \"limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege\" Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy & State with Power and Market, Mises.org \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in inalienable human rights and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will, which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured slavery. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract. Nozick, Robert (1973) Anarchy, State, and Utopia \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, David Friedman has expressed preference for a society where \"almost everyone is self-employed\" and \"instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces.\" Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper & Row. pp. 144â\\\\x80\\\\x9345 Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Law and order and the use of violence===\\\\n\\', \\'Different anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism, and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. Morris and Linda Tannehill, in The Market for Liberty, object to any statutory law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see tort and contract law) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.

That is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial, and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. Also, if competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists.

The concept of Restitution Transfer and Recoupment (RTR) has been explored by freenation theorist John Frederic Kosanke. RTR agencies would employ bonding agencies, private investigators, private dispute resolution organizations, and private aggressor containment agencies, as required.

The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. Retributive justice, meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe prisons or indentured servitude would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations, while others believe exile or forced restitution are sufficient.

Benson argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that, despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, \"standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses.\" The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees\\\\\\' and customers\\\\\\' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller\\\\\\'s call for help. But the robber\\\\\\'s loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk, and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'One difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including anarcho-capitalist revolution) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire the American Revolution as the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against tyrannical restrictions of their liberties. In fact, according to Murray Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified. Rothbard, Murray N. (1973) Interview Reason February 1973.

Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in The Machinery of Freedom. Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56 Also unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on \"market failure\", but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see \"government failure\") to compare the net result. Nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a normative benchmark. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since, in the absence of the state, sovereign individuals will make their own decisions about morality, and will be held accountable via tort and contract law.

In particular they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary, and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which is incompatible with an anarchist society. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On the other hand, anarcho-capitalists such as Per Bylund, webmaster of the anarchism without adjectives website, note that the disconnect among non-anarcho-capitalist anarchists is likely the result of an \"unfortunate situation of fundamental misinterpretation of anarcho-capitalism.\" Bylund asks, \"How can one from this historical heritage claim to be both anarchist and advocate of the exploitative system of capitalism?\" and answers it by pointing out that \"no one can, and no one does. There are no anarchists approving of such a system, even anarcho-capitalists (for the most part) do not.\" Bylund, Per. Anarchism, Capitalism, and Anarcho-Capitalism, anarchism.net. 6 July 2004. Bylund explains this as follows:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Murray N. Rothbard argues that the capitalist system of today is, indeed, not properly anarchistic because it is so often in collusion with the state. According to Rothbard, \"what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call \\\\\\'free-market capitalism\\\\\\' on the one hand, and \\\\\\'state capitalism\\\\\\' on the other.\" Rothbard, Murray N. Future of Peace and Capitalism, James H. Weaver, ed., Modern Political Economy (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1973), pp. 419â\\\\x80\\\\x9330 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\"The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism,\" writes Rothbard, \"is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation.\" He goes on to point out that he is \"very optimistic about the future of free-market capitalism. I\\\\\\'m not optimistic about the future of state capitalism â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or rather, I am optimistic, because I think it will eventually come to an end. State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Murray Rothbard maintains that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism Rothbard, Murray N. Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard. The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal. 25 February 1972. â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality, as, he argues, any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology (redistribution of private property, etc.). In short, while granting that certain non-coercive hierarchies will exist under an anarcho-capitalist system, they will have no real authority except over their own property: a worker existing within such a \\'hierarchy\\' (answerable to management, bosses, etc.) is free at all times to abandon this voluntary \\'hierarchy\\' and (1) create an organization within which he/she is at (or somewhere near) the top of the \\'hierarchy\\' (entrepreneurship), (2) join an existing \\'hierarchy\\' (wherein he/she will likely be lower in the scheme of things), or (3) abandon these hierarchies altogether and join/form a non-hierarchical association such as a cooperative, commune, etc.. Since there will be no taxes, such cooperative organizations (labour unions, communes, voluntary socialist associations wherein the product of the labour and of the capital goods of those who join which they were able to peaceably acquire would be shared amongst all who joined, etc.) would, under anarcho-capitalism, enjoy the freedom to do as they please (provided, of course that they set up their operation on their own â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or un-owned â\\\\x80\\\\x93 property, in other words so long as they do so without force).\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority, and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society: cooperatives, non-profit organizations (which would, just as today, be funded by individuals for their existence), businesses, etc. (in short, a free market does not equal the end of civil society, which continues to be a critique of anarcho-capitalism). Moreover, anarcho-capitalists (as well as classical liberal minarchists and others) argue that the application of so-called \"leftist\" anarchist ideals would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. Some also argue that human beings are motivated primarily by the fulfillment of their own needs and wants. Thus, to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital, which could result in further fulfillment of human desires, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to, in essence, exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively \\\\\\'egalitarian\\\\\\'-anarchist system. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Anarcho-capitalism and Austrian economics==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Austrian School of economics argued against the viability of socialism and centrally planned economic policy. Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk, a colleague of Austrian school founder Carl Menger, wrote one of the first critiques of socialism in his treatise The Exploitation Theory of Socialism-Communism. Later, Friedrich von Hayek wrote The Road to Serfdom, which states that a command economy lacks the information function of market prices, and that central authority over the economy leads to totalitarianism. Another Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, wrote Human Action, an early exposition of the method he called Praxeology.\\\\n\\', \\'Murray Rothbard (1926â\\\\x80\\\\x9395).\\\\n\\', \\'Murray Rothbard, a student of Mises, attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating \"private property anarchism\" in 1949, and later came up with the alternative name \"anarcho-capitalism.\" He was probably the first to use \"libertarian\" in its current (U.S.) pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the Old Right, an anti-statist and anti-interventionist branch of the Republican party. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with Ayn Rand, but later had a falling out. When interventionist cold warriors of the National Review, such as William F. Buckley, Jr., gained influence in the Republican party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with left-wing antiwar groups. He believed that the cold warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to Trotskyist theory. Rothbard, Murray N. LewRockwell.com. Retrieved 10 September 2006. Later, Rothbard initially opposed the founding of the Libertarian Party but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==History==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Classical liberalism===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Classical liberalism is the primary influence with the longest history on anarcho-capitalist theory. Classical liberals have had two main themes since John Locke first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man, and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of natural rights, while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a consent theory.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bastiat (The Law), who wrote, \"The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else.\" Henry David Thoreau wrote, \"I heartily accept the motto, \\\\\\'That government is best which governs least\\\\\\'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, \\\\\\'That government is best which governs not at all\\\\\\'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.\" Thoreau, Henry David (1849) Civil Disobedience \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property, and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The \"normative core\" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of laissez-faire, a spontaneous order of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants. Razeen, Sally. Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History, Routledge (UK) ISBN 978-0-415-16493-1, 1998, p. 17 Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services, and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So, they advocated what may be seen as classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France\\\\\\'s Jakob Mauvillon in the 18th century. Later, in the 1840s, Julius Faucher and Gustave de Molinari advocated the same.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Molinari, in his essay The Production of Security, argued, \"No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.\" Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian Ralph Raico argues that what these liberal philosophers \"had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism.\" Raico, Ralph (2004) Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, UnitÃ© associÃ©e au CNRS Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people â\\\\x80\\\\x93 society â\\\\x80\\\\x93 and the institutions of force â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the State. This society versus state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority, and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few. The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of Herbert Spencer, as well as in thinkers such as Paul Ã\\\\x89mile de Puydt and Auberon Herbert.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ulrike Heider, in discussing the \"anarcho-capitalist family tree,\" argues in favor of Max Stirner as the \"founder of individualist anarchism\" and \"ancestor of laissez-faire liberalism.\" Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95â\\\\x80\\\\x9396 According to Heider, Stirner wants to \"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members\" and \"derives his identity solely from property\" with the question of property to be resolved by a \\\\\\'war of all against all\\\\\\'.\" Stirner argued against the existence of the state in a fundamentally anti-collectivist way, to be replaced by a \"Union of Egoists\" but was not more explicit than that in his book The Ego and Its Own published in 1844.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Later, in the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the \"Old Right\". These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists, and (later) anti-New Dealers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were Albert Jay Nock, Rose Wilder Lane, Isabel Paterson, Frank Chodorov, Garet Garrett, and H. L. Mencken. In the 1950s, the new \"fusion conservatism\", also called \"cold war conservatism\", took hold of the right wing in the U.S., stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right, and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the (U.S.) Libertarian Party.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Nineteenth century individualist anarchism in the United States===\\\\n\\', \\'Lysander Spooner (1808â\\\\x80\\\\x9387)\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists \"...only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by these men. Most had not evolved consciously from this tradition; they had been a rather automatic product of the American environment.\" DeLeon, David. The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978, p. 127 (who were also influenced by classical liberalism). In the winter of 1949, influenced by several 19th century individualists anarchists, Rothbard decided to reject minimal state laissez-faire and embrace individualist anarchism. Gordon, David. The Essential Rothbard. Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2007. pp. 12â\\\\x80\\\\x9313. Rothbard said in 1965 \"The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist\\\\\\'s View.\" A Way Out. Mayâ\\\\x80\\\\x93June 1965. Later republished in Egalitarianism As A Revolt Against Nature by Rothbard, 1974. Later published in Journal of Libertarian Studies, 2000. The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist\\\\\\'s View \"Lysander Spooner and Benjamin T. Tucker were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy.\" However, he thought they had a faulty understanding of economics. The 19th century individualists had a labor theory of value, as influenced by the classical economists, but Rothbard was a student of Austrian Economics which does not agree with the labor theory of value. So, Rothbard sought to meld 19th-century American individualists\\\\\\' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: \"There is, in the body of thought known as \\\\\\'Austrian economics\\\\\\', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung\". \"The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist\\\\\\'s View, Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000) Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Rothbard disagreed with this, as he explains in The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist\\\\\\'s View. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase, because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur, so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless, because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Also, Tucker held a labor theory of value. As a result, he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or \"usury\" was taking place. As he explains in State Socialism and Anarchism, his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated, and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. Again, as a neoclassical economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory. He believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to marginal utility rather than to labor amounts in free market. And he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much others subjectively value their labor or what that labor produces, even if it means people laboring the same amount receive different incomes.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Benjamin Tucker opposed vast concentrations of wealth, which he believed were made possible by government intervention and state protected monopolies. He believed the most dangerous state intervention was the requirement that individuals obtain charters in order to operate banks and what he believed to be the illegality of issuing private money, which he believed caused capital to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few which he called the \"banking monopoly.\" He believed anyone should be able to engage in banking that wished, without requiring state permission, and issue private money. Though he was supporter of laissez-faire, late in life he said that State intervention had allowed some extreme concentrations of resources to such a degree that even if laissez-faire were instituted, it would be too late for competition to be able to release those resources (he gave Standard Oil as an example). Tucker, Benjamin. State Socialism and Anarchism Anarcho-capitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking. They, like all Austrian economists, believe that monopoly can only come about through government intervention. 19th-century American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economy.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Although anarcho-capitalists disagree on the critical topics of profit, social egalitarianism, and the proper scope of private property, both schools of thought agree on other issues. Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of \"sovereignty of the individual\", a market economy, and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point that they agree on is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the State. Tucker said, \"efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices.\" Tucker, Benjamin. \"Instead of a Book\" (1893) \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since anarcho-capitalists disagree with Tucker\\\\\\'s labor theory of value, they disagree that free market competition would cause protection (or anything else) to be provided \"at cost.\" Like the 19th-century American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner, anarcho-capitalists believe that land may be originally appropriated by, and only by, occupation or use; however, most American individualists of the 19th century believed it must continually be in use to retain title. Lysander Spooner was an exception from those who believed in the \"occupation and use\" theory, and believed in full private property rights in land, like Rothbard. Watner, Carl. Spooner Vs.

A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the Second Punic War, Quintus Maximus Fabius Cunctator used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of Scipio Africanus, who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against Antiochus III the Great in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus used their own resources to suppress the armies of Spartacus in the Third Servile War. Julius Caesar made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by conquering Gaul.

Eleven of his thirty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and they are used to define the genre.

Barrett (2003) page 26 His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries; Plato The Apology translated by Benjamin Jowett, section 4 Apology, Greek text, edited J. Burnet, section 19c singled out Aristophanes\\\\\\' play The Clouds as slander that contributed to the trial and subsequent condemning to death of Socrates although other satirical playwrights Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds Alan Sommerstein, Penguin Books 1973, p16 had also caricatured the philosopher. His second play, The Babylonians (now lost), was denounced by the demagogue Cleon as a slander against the Athenian polis. It is possible that the case was argued in court but details of the trial are not recorded and Aristophanes caricatured Cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays, especially The Knights, the first of many plays that he directed himself. \"In my opinion,\" he says through the Chorus in that play, \"the author-director of comedies has the hardest job of all.\" () Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Knights ln 516 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Biography==\\\\n\\', \"Theatre of Dionysus, Athens â\\\\x80\\\\x94 in Aristophanes\\' time, the audience probably sat on wooden benches with earth foundations. Barrett (1964) p.21 \\\\n\", \"Less is known about Aristophanes than about his plays. In fact, his plays are the main source of information about him. It was conventional in Old Comedy for the Chorus to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the \\'parabasis\\' and thus some biographical facts can be got \\'straight from the horse\\'s mouth\\', so to speak. However, these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life. Greek Comedy and Ideology David Konstan, Oxford University Press US 1995, page 6 He was a comic poet in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of \\'teacher\\' (didaskalos), and though this specifically referred to his training of the Chorus in rehearsal, it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues. Aristophanes: The Clouds K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page XIV Aristophanes claimed to be writing for a clever and discerning audience, Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts,Clouds 520-25 yet he also declared that \\'other times\\' would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays. Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts,Clouds 560-62 He sometimes boasts of his originality as a dramatist Wasps 1536-7 Wikisource original Greek, Clouds 545-48, Peace 739-58 yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in Athenian society. He caricatured leading figures in the arts (notably Euripides, whose influence on his own work however he once begrudgingly acknowledged), Barrett (2003) p.9 in politics (especially the populist Cleon), and in philosophy/religion (where Socrates was the most obvious target). Such caricatures seem to imply that Aristophanes was an old-fashioned conservative, yet that view of him leads to contradictions. Greek Society Antony Andrewes, Pelican Books, 1981, pages 247-48 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"The writing of plays was a craft that could be handed down from father to son, and it has been argued that Aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A.H. Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1975, page9, footnote The plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens, the Lenaia and City Dionysia, where they were judged and awarded places relative to the works of other comic dramatists. An elaborate series of lotteries, designed to prevent prejudice and corruption, reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five in number. These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences Barrett (1964) p.26 yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences. Barrett (1964) p.25 The theatres were certainly huge, with seating for at least 10 000 at the Theatre of Dionysus. The day\\'s program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded, with three tragedies and a \\'satyr\\' play ahead of the comedy, and it is possible that many of the poorer citizens (typically the main supporters of demagogues like Cleon) occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits. The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of a dominant group in an unrepresentative audience. The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays. Throughout most of Aristophanes\\' career, the Chorus was essential to a play\\'s success and it was recruited and funded by a choregus, a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the archons. A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour, but Aristophanes showed in The Knights that wealthy citizens could regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon. Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, The Knights lines 911-25 Thus the political conservatism of the plays might reflect the views of the wealthiest section of society, on whose generosity comic dramatists depended for the success of their plays. W.Rennie, The Acharnians of Aristophanes, Arnold (publisher)|] (London, 1909), page 7, reproduced by Bibliolife \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"When Aristophanes\\' first play The Banqueters was produced, Athens was an ambitious, imperial power and The Peloponnesian War was only in its fourth year. His plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation (the victors at Marathon) Wasps 1075-1101 Wikisource original Greek, Knights 565-576 Acharnians Wikisource Greek text 692-700 yet they are not jingoistic and they are staunchly opposed to the war with Sparta. The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers, among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently. By the time his last play was produced (around 386 BC) Athens had been defeated in war, its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from the political to the intellectual centre of Greece. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A.H.Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1975, pp 13-14 Aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period â\\\\x80\\\\x94 the structure of his plays evolves from Old Comedy until, in his last surviving play, Wealth II, it more closely resembles New Comedy. However it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations.

The details of the trial are unrecorded but, speaking through the hero of his third play The Acharnians (staged at the Lenaia, where there were few or no foreign dignitaries), the poet carefully distinguishes between the polis and the real targets of his acerbic wit:\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\' The Acharnians, Wikisource lines 515-17 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"::People among us, and I don\\'t mean the polis,\\\\n\", \"::Remember this â\\\\x80\\\\x94 I don\\'t mean the polis -\\\\n\", \\'::But wicked little men of a counterfeit kind....\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Aristophanes repeatedly savages Cleon in his later plays. But these satirical diatribes appear to have had no effect on Cleon\\'s political career â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a few weeks after the performance of The Knights, a play full of anti-Cleon jokes, Cleon was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals. Barrett (2003) p.34 Cleon also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Aristophanes: the caricatures of him continued up to and even beyond his death.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In the absence of clear biographical facts about Aristophanes, scholars make educated guesses based on interpretation of the language in the plays. Inscriptions and summaries or comments by Hellenistic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues. We know however from a combination of these sources, D.Welsh, IG ii2 2343, Philonides and Aristophanes\\\\\\' Banqueters, Classical Quarterly 33 (1983) and especially from comments in The Knights Knights 512-14 and The Clouds, Clouds 530-33 that Aristophanes\\\\\\' first three plays were not directed by him â\\\\x80\\\\x94 they were instead directed by Callistratus and Philoneides, Ian Storey, General Introduction, in Clouds, Wasps, Birds By Aristophanes, Peter Meineck (translator), Hackett Publishing 1998, page xiii an arrangement that seemed to suit Aristophanes since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well (Philoneides for example later directed The Frogs and he was also credited, perhaps wrongly, with directing The Wasps.) MacDowell (1971) p.124 Aristophanes\\\\\\'s use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information since apparent self-references might have been made on behalf of his directors instead. Thus for example a statement by the chorus in The Acharnians The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines 652-54 seems to indicate that the \\\\\\'poet\\\\\\' had a close, personal association with the island of Aegina, yet the terms \\\\\\'poet\\\\\\' (poietes) and \\\\\\'director\\\\\\' (didaskalos) are often interchangeable since dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Aristophanes or Callistratus. Similarly, the hero in The Acharnians complains about Cleon \"dragging me into court\" over \"last year\\\\\\'s play\" Acharnians Wikisource original Greek 377-82 but here again it is not clear if this was said on behalf of Aristophanes or Callistratus, either of whom might have been prosecuted by Cleon.

Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds Alan Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Classics 1975, page 9 The second parabasis in Wasps Wasps Wikisource original Greek lines 1265-91 appears to indicate that he reached some kind of temporary accommodation with Cleon following either the controversy over The Babylonians or a subsequent controversy over The Knights. MacDowell (1978) p.299 It has been inferred from statements in The Clouds and Peace that Aristophanes was prematurely bald. Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M.

Aristophanes:Clouds K.J.Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page IX note 1. It purports to be a record of conversations at a dinner party at which both Aristophanes and Socrates are guests, held some seven years after the performance of The Clouds, the play in which Socrates was cruelly caricatured. One of the guests, Alcibiades, even quotes from the play when teasing Socrates over his appearance Symposium 221B; Plato Vol.3, Loeb Classical Library (1975), page 236 and yet there is no indication of any ill-feeling between Socrates and Aristophanes. Plato\\'s Aristophanes is in fact a genial character and this has been interpreted as evidence of Plato\\'s own friendship with him Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds Alan Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Books 1973, page10 (their friendship appears to be corroborated by an epitaph for Aristophanes, reputedly written by Plato, in which the playwright\\'s soul is compared to an eternal shrine for the Graces). Barrett (2003) p.10 Plato was only a boy when the events in The Symposium are supposed to have occurred and it is possible that his Aristophanes is in fact based on a reading of the plays. For example, conversation among the guests turns to the subject of Love and Aristophanes explains his notion of it in terms of an amusing allegory, a device he often uses in his plays. He is represented as suffering an attack of hiccoughs and this might be a humorous reference to the crude physical jokes in his plays. He tells the other guests that he is quite happy to be thought amusing but he is wary of appearing ridiculous. The Symposium original Greek text:section 189b The Symposium (English translation) Benjamin Jowett (scroll half way down).

The Orator\\'s Training Quintilian 10.1.65-6, cited in Barrett (2003) p.15 Quintilian 10.1.65-6 10.1.61 A revival of interest in the Attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of Aristophanes\\' plays during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, resulting in their survival today. In Aristophanes\\' plays, the Attic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualities.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"For Aristophanes\\' contemporaries the works of Homer and Hesiod formed the cornerstone of Hellenes history and culture. Thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satire. Barrett (1964) pp. 151-52 Aristophanes was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references to other poets. These include not only rival comic dramatists such as Eupolis and Hermippus Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Clouds lines 553-54 and predecessors such as Magnes, Crates and Cratinus, Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Knights lines 519-40 but also tragedians, notably Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, all three of whom are mentioned in e.g. The Frogs. Aristophanes was the equal of these great tragedians in his subtle use of lyrics. Barrett (1964) p.30 He appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of Euripides in particular, so much so that the comic dramatist Cratinus labelled him a \\'Euripidaristophanist\\' addicted to hair-splitting niceties. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"A full appreciation of Aristophanes\\' plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill, and of their different rhythms and associations. MacDowell (1978) p.21 There were three broad poetic forms: iambic dialogue, tetrameter verses and lyrics: Barrett (2003) pp.7-8 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Iambic dialogue: Aristophanes achieves an effect resembling natural speech through the use of the iambic trimeter (corresponding to the effects achieved by English poets such as Shakespeare using iambic pentameters). His realistic use of the metre MacDowell (1978) p.16 makes it ideal for both dialogue and soliloquy, as for instance in the prologue, before the arrival of the Chorus, when the audience is introduced to the main issues in the plot. The Acharnians opens with these three lines by the hero, Dikaiopolis (rendered here in English as iambic pentameters):\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'::How many are the things that vex my heart!\\\\n\\', \\'::Pleasures are few, so very few â\\\\x80\\\\x94 just four -\\\\n\\', \\'::But stressful things are manysandthousandsandheaps! Original Greek, Wikisource The Acharnians lines 1-3 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \":Here Aristophanes employs a frequent device, arranging the syntax so that the final word in a line comes as a comic climax. MacDowell (1978) p.17 The hero\\'s pleasures are so few he can number them (, four) but his causes for complaint are so many they beggar numerical description and he must invent his own word for them (, literally \\'sandhundredheaps\\', here paraphrased \\'manysandthousandsandheaps\\'). The use of invented compound words is another comic device frequently found in the plays. MacDowell (1978) p.13 Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds Alan Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, page 37 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Tetrameter catalectic verses: These are long lines of anapests, trochees or iambs (where each line is ideally measured in four dipodes or pairs of feet), used in various situations within each play such as:\\\\n\\', \\'** formal debates or agons between characters (typically in anapestic rhythm);\\\\n\\', \\'** excited dialogue or heated argument (typically trochaic rhythm, the same as in early tragedy);\\\\n\\', \\'** long speeches declaimed by the Chorus in parabases (in either anapestic or trochaic rhythms);\\\\n\\', \\'** informal debates barely above the level of ordinary dialogue (typically iambic).\\\\n\\', \":Anapestic rhythms are naturally jaunty (as in many limericks) and trochaic metre is suited to rapid delivery (the word \\'trochee\\' is in fact derived from trechein, \\'to run\\', as demonstrated for example by choruses who enter at speed, often in aggressive mood) L.P.E. Parker, The Songs of Aristophanes, Oxford, 1997, p. 36 However, even though both these rhythms can seem to \\'bowl along\\' Barrett (2003) p.27 Aristophanes often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted metres, adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument. In an anapestic passage in The Frogs, for instance, the character Aeschylus presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god, Dionysus:\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'::AES.:It was Orpheus singing who taught us religion and how wrong people are when they kill,\\\\n\\', \\'::And we learned from Musaeus medicinal cures and the science of divination.\\\\n\\', \"::If it\\'s farming you want, Hesiod knows it all, when to plant, when to harvest. How godlike\\\\n\", \"::Homer got to be famous, I\\'ll tell if you ask: he taught us what all good men should know,\\\\n\", \\'::Discipline, fortitude, battle-readiness. DIO.: But no-one taught Pantocles â\\\\x80\\\\x94 yesterday\\\\n\\', \\'::He was marching his men up and down on parade when the crest of his helmet fell off! Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 2, F.W.Hall and W.M.Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Frogs lines 1032-38 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"The rhythm begins at a typical anapestic gallop, slows down to consider the revered poets Hesiod and Homer, then gallops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate Pantocles. Such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays, allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audience\\'s appetite for the next joke.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Lyrics: Almost nothing is known about the music that accompanied Greek lyrics, and the metre is often so varied and complex that it is difficult for modern readers or audiences to get a feel for the intended effects, yet Aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity of his lyrics. Some of the most memorable and haunting lyrics are dignified hymns set free of the comic action Greek Drama, Peter Levi, in The Oxford History of the Classical World edited by J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray, Oxford University Press 1986, page 175 In the example below, taken from The Wasps, the lyric is merely a comic interlude and the rhythm is steadily trochaic. The syntax in the original Greek is natural and unforced and it was probably accompanied by brisk and cheerful music, gliding to a concluding pun at the expense of Amynias, who is thought to have lost his fortune gambling. MacDowell (1978) p.27 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'::Though to myself I often seem\\\\n\\', \\':::A bright chap and not awkward,\\\\n\\', \\'::None comes close to Amynias,\\\\n\\', \\':::Son of Sellos of the Bigwig\\\\n\\', \\'::Clan, a man I once saw\\\\n\\', \\':::Dine with rich Leogorus.\\\\n\\', \\'::Now as poor as Antiphon,\\\\n\\', \\':::He lives on apples and pomegranates\\\\n\\', \\'::Yet he got himself appointed\\\\n\\', \\':::Ambassador to Pharselus,\\\\n\\', \\'::Way up there in Thessaly,\\\\n\\', \\':::Home of the poor Penestes:\\\\n\\', \\'::Happy to be where everyone\\\\n\\', \\':::Is as penniless as he is! MacDowell (1978), Wikisource: lines 1265-74 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\':The pun here in English translation (Penestes-penniless) is a weak version of the Greek pun , PenÃ©staisi-penÃ©stÄ\\\\x95s, \"destitute\". Many of the puns in the plays are based on words that are similar rather than identical, and it has been observed that there could be more of them than scholars have yet been able to identify. Barrett (2003) p.21 Others are based on double meanings. Sometimes entire scenes are constructed on puns, as in The Acharnians with the Megarian farmer and his pigs: The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines 729-835 the Megaran farmer defies the Athenian embargo against Megaran trade, and tries to trade his daughters disguised as pigs, except \"pig\" was ancient slang for \"vagina\". Since the embargo against Megara was the pretext for the Peloponnesian War, Aristophanes naturally concludes that this whole mess happened because of \"three cunts\".\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"It can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery, particularly the use of similes, metaphors and pictorial expressions. In \\'The Knights\\', for example, the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as parasols that open and close. Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Knights lines 1347-48; In The Frogs, Aeschylus is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sandpit. The Frogs lines 902-4 Some plays feature revelations of human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious in character, such as the marriage of the hero Pisthetairos to Zeus\\'s paramour in The Birds and the \\'recreation\\' of old Athens, crowned with roses, at the end of The Knights.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Aristophanes and Old Comedy==\\\\n\\', \"Thalia, muse of comedy, gazing upon a comic mask (detail from Muses\\' Sarcophagus)\\\\n\", \"The Greek word for comedy (kÅ\\\\x8dmÅ\\\\x8didÃ\\\\xada) derives from the words for \\'revel\\' and \\'song\\' (kÅ\\\\x8dmos and Å\\\\x8ddÄ\\\\x93) and according to Aristotle The Poetics 1449a11, Wikisource English translation section IV comic drama actually developed from song. The first official comedy at the City Dionysia was not staged until 487/6 BC, Clouds translated by Peter Meineck with introduction by Ian Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, page IX by which time tragedy had already been long established there. The first comedy at the Lenaia was staged later still, ibid page XIX only about 20 years before the performance there of The Acharnians, the first of Aristophanes\\' surviving plays. According to Aristotle, comedy was slow to gain official acceptance because nobody took it seriously, The Poetics 1448b38 - 1449b, Wikisource English translation section V yet only sixty years after comedy first appeared at the City Dionysia, Aristophanes observed that producing comedies was the most difficult work of all. Aristophanis Comoediae vol. 1, F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart (eds), Oxford Classical Texts, Knights line 516 Competition at the Dionysian festivals needed dramatic conventions for plays to be judged, but it also fuelled innovations. Aristophanes:The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 12 Developments were quite rapid and Aristotle could distinguish between \\'old\\' and \\'new\\' comedy by 330 BC. Nichomachean Ethics 1128a 21-24 The trend from Old Comedy to New Comedy saw a move away from highly topical concerns with real individuals and local issues towards generalized situations and stock characters. This was partly due to the internationalization of cultural perspectives during and after the Peloponnesian War. Ralph Rosen, Aristophanes 3, D. Slavitt and P. Bovie (eds), University of Pennsylvania Press 1999, page XIV Clouds translated by P. Meineck with introduction by I. Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII For ancient commentators such as Plutarch, Comparison of Aristophanes and Menander New Comedy was a more sophisticated form of drama than Old Comedy. However, Old Comedy was in fact a complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches to humour and entertainment. Clouds translated by P. Meineck with introduction by I.Storey, Hackett Publishing 2000, page VII In Aristophanes\\' early plays, the genre appears to have developed around a complex set of dramatic conventions, and these were only gradually simplified and abandoned.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"The City Dionysia and the Lenaia were celebrated in honour of Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy. (Euripides\\' play The Bacchae offers the best insight into 5th century ideas about this god.) Clouds P. Meineck (translator) and I. Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII Old Comedy can be understood as a celebration of the exuberant sense of release inherent in his worship Clouds P. Meineck (translator) and I. Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page XIX It was more interested in finding targets for satire than in any kind of advocacy. Greek Society Antony Andrewes, Pelican Books 1981, page 247 During the City Dionysia, a statue of the god was brought to the theatre from a temple outside the city, and it remained in the theatre throughout the festival, overseeing the plays like a privileged member of the audience. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A.Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 18 In The Frogs, the god appears also as a dramatic character, and he enters the theatre ludicrously disguised as Hercules. He observes to the audience that every time he is on hand to hear a joke from a comic dramatist like Phrynichus (one of Aristophanes\\' rivals) he ages by more than a year. Frogs Wikisource English translation ; original Greek text lines 12-18 This scene opens the play, and it is a reminder to the audience that nobody is above mockery in Old Comedy â\\\\x80\\\\x94 not even its patron god and its practitioners. Gods, artists, politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate targets, comedy was a kind of licensed buffoonery, Greek Society Antony Andrewes, Pelican Books 1981, page 248 and there was no legal redress for anyone who was slandered in a play. Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 27 There were certain limits to the scope of the satire, but they are not easily defined. Impiety could be punished in 5th century Athens, but the absurdities implicit in the traditional religion were open to ridicule. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 17 The polis was not allowed to be slandered, but as stated in the biography section of this article, that could depend on who was in the audience and which festival was involved.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"For convenience, Old Comedy, as represented by Aristophanes\\' early plays, is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics â\\\\x80\\\\x94 topicality, festivity and complexity. Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes\\' plays. However, it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate section.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Topicality===\\\\n\\', \"Old Comedy\\'s emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries â\\\\x80\\\\x94 see for example articles on The Knights, The Wasps and Peace for lists of topical references. The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Individual masks: All actors in classical Athens wore masks, but whereas in tragedy and New Comedy these identified stereotypical characters, in Old Comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people. Perhaps Socrates attracted a lot of attention in Old Comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 31 In The Knights we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of Cleon (there represented as a Paphlagonian slave) but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anyway. Knights lines 230-33 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"* The real scene of action: Since Old Comedy makes numerous references to people in the audience, the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke. In The Acharnians, for example, The Pnyx is just a few steps from the hero\\'s front door, and in Peace Olympia is separated from Athens by a few moments\\' supposed flight on a dung beetle. The audience is sometimes drawn or even dragged into the action. When the hero in Peace returns to Athens from his flight to Olympia, he tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the heavens, and seen up close they look even worse. Peace 821-23 In The Acharnians the hero confronts the archon basileus, The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines 1224-25 sitting in the front row, and demands to be awarded first prize for a drinking competition, which is a none too subtle way for Aristophanes to request first prize for the drama competition.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Self-mocking theatre: Frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of Old Comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand. But the Lenaia and City Dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies, and thus references to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audience. \"Greek Drama\" Peter Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World J.Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 176 The comic dramatist also poked fun at comic poets and he even ridiculed himself. It is possible, as indicated earlier, that Aristophanes mocked his own baldness. In The Clouds, the Chorus compares him to an unwed, young mother Clouds lines 528-33 and in The Acharnians the Chorus mockingly depicts him as Athens\\\\\\' greatest weapon in the war against Sparta. Acharnians lines 646-51 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"* Political theatre: The Lenaia and City Dionysus were state-sponsored, religious festivals, and though the latter was the more prestigious of the two, both were occasions for official pomp and circumstance. The ceremonies for the Lenaia were overseen by the archon basileus and by officials of the Eleusinian mysteries. The City Dionysia was overseen by the archon eponymous and the priest of Dionysus. Opening ceremonies for the City Dionysia featured, in addition to the ceremonial arrival of the god, a parade in full armour of the sons of warriors who died fighting for the polis and, until the end of the Peloponnesian War, a presentation of annual tribute from subject states. Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A.Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, pages 18-19 Religious and political issues were topics that could hardly be ignored in such a setting and the plays often treat them quite seriously. Even jokes can be serious when the topic is politics â\\\\x80\\\\x94 especially in wartime. The butts of the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey on the gullibility of their fellow citizens, including oracle-mongers, e.g. Knights lines 997-1095; Birds lines 959-91 the exponents of new religious practices, e.g. Clouds lines 263-66, Frogs lines 891-94 war-profiteers and political fanatics. In The Acharnians, for example, Lamachus is represented as a crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared to the hero\\'s preparations for a dinner party. Acharnians lines 1097-1142 lines Cleon emerges from numerous similes and metaphors in The Knights as a protean form of comic evil, clinging to political power by every possible means for as long as he can, yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking Poseidon and Athena, Knights lines 551-64 and 581-594 and it ends with visions of a miraculously transformed Demos (i.e. the morally reformed citizenry of Athens). Knights lines 1321-38 Imaginative visions of a return to peaceful activities resulting from peace with Sparta, e.g. Peace lines 551-97 and a plea for leniency for citizens suspected of complicity in an oligarchic revolt Frogs lines 686-705 are other examples of a serious purpose behind the plays.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Teasing and taunting: A festival audience presented the comic dramatist with a wide range of targets, not just political or religious ones â\\\\x80\\\\x94 anyone known to the audience could be mocked for any reason, such as diseases, physical deformities, ugliness, family misfortunes, bad manners, perversions, dishonesty, cowardice in battle, and clumsiness. Aristophanes: Clouds K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, pages XIII-XIV Foreigners, a conspicuous presence in imperial Athens, particularly at the City Dionysia, often appear in the plays comically mispronouncing Attic words â\\\\x80\\\\x94 these include Spartans (Lysistrata), Scythians (Thesmophoriazusae), Persians, Boeotians and Megarians (The Acharnians).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Festivity===\\\\n\\', \\'The Lenaia and City Dionysia were religious festivals, but they resembled a gala rather than a church service. Aristophanes: Clouds K.J. Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, page XV \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Dirty jokes: A relaxation in standards of behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and gods. \"Greek Drama\" Peter Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World, Oxford University Press 1986, page 175 Old Comedy is rich in obscenities and the crude jokes are often very detailed, as when the Chorus in The Acharnians places a curse on Antimachus, The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines 1164-73 a choregus accused of niggardly conduct, wishing upon him a night-time mugging as he returns home from some drunken party and envisioning him, as he stoops down to pick up a rock in the darkness, accidentally picking up a fresh turd instead. He is then envisioned hurling the turd at his attacker, missing and accidentally hitting Cratinus, a lyric poet not admired by Aristophanes. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pages 243-4, notes 69,80,81 This was particularly funny because the curse was sung (or chanted) in choreographed style by a Chorus of 24 grown men who were otherwise known to the audience as respectable citizens.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"* The musical extravaganza: The Chorus was vital to the success of a play in Old Comedy long after it had lost its relevance for tragedy. Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pages 14-15 Technically, the competition in the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between choruses. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, page 23 In fact eight of Aristophanes\\' eleven surviving plays are named after the Chorus. In Aristophanes\\' time, the Chorus in tragedy was relatively small (twelve members) and its role had been reduced to that of an awkwardly placed commentator, but in Old Comedy the Chorus was large (numbering 24), it was actively involved in the plot, its entry into the action was frequently spectacular, its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes it was involved in choreographed skirmishes with the actors. The Acharnians lines 280-301 Wikisource original Greek; Knights lines 247-72; Wasps lines 452-460 Wikisource original Greek The expenditure on costumes, training and maintenance of a Chorus was considerable, Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, page 9 and perhaps many people in the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and music. Aristophanes: Wasps Douglas MacDowell (ed), Oxford University Press 1978, page 14-15 The chorus gradually lost its significance as New Comedy began to develop.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"* Obvious costumes: Consistent with the holiday spirit, much of the humour in Old Comedy is slapstick buffoonery that doesn\\'t require the audience\\'s careful attention, often relying on visual cues. Actors playing male roles appear to have worn tights over grotesque padding, with a prodigious, leather phallus barely concealed by a short tunic. Female characters were played by men but were easily recognized in long, saffron tunics. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, page 29 Sometimes the visual cues are deliberately confused for comic effect, as in The Frogs, where Dionysus arrives on stage in a saffron tunic, the buskin boots of a tragic actor and a lion skin cloak that usually characterized Heracles - an absurd outfit that provokes the character Heracles (as no doubt it provoked the audience) to guffaws of helpless mirth. Frogs lines 45-47 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"* The farcical anti-climax: The holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences. The major confrontation (agon) between the \\'good\\' and \\'bad\\' characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play. The rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes. The farcical anti-climax has been explained in a variety of ways, depending on the particular play. In The Wasps, for instance, it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main character\\'s perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbed. Aristophanes: Wasps Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 7 In The Acharnians, it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes, demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdom. Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics, pages 33-34 But the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in Old Comedy Aristophanes\\' Old-and-new Comedy Kenneth J.Reckford, UNC Press 1987, page 15 and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle, the music, jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play. The celebration of the hero\\'s victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding, thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closure. Aristophanes: The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett, Penguin Classics 1964, pages 13-14 \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Complexity===\\\\n\\', \\'The development of New Comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots, a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone. Aristophanes D. Slavitt and P. Bovie (eds), University of Pennsylvania Press 1999, page XIII Old Comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour, even to the point of undermining the humour itself. Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy M.S.Silk, Oxford University Press 2002, page 418 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Inclusive comedy: Old Comedy provided a variety of entertainments for a diverse audience. It accommodated a serious purpose, light entertainment, hauntingly beautiful lyrics, the buffoonery of puns and invented words, obscenities, disciplined verse, wildly absurd plots and a formal, dramatic structure.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"* Fantasy and absurdity: Fantasy in Old Comedy is unrestricted and impossibilities are ignored. Aristophanes: Clouds K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, page XIII Situations are developed logically to absurd conclusions, an approach to humour that is echoed for instance in the works of Lewis Carroll and EugÃ¨ne Ionesco (the Theatre of the Absurd). Aristophanes: Wasps Douglas MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 12 The crazy costume worn by Dionysus in The Frogs is typical of an absurd result obtained on logical grounds â\\\\x80\\\\x94 he wears a woman\\'s saffron-coloured tunic because effeminacy is an aspect of his divinity, buskin boots because he is interested in reviving the art of tragedy, and a lion skin cape because, like Heracles, his mission leads him into Hades. Absurdities develop logically from initial premises in a plot. In The Knights for instance, Cleon\\'s corrupt service to the people of Athens is originally depicted as a household relationship in which the slave dupes his master. The introduction of a rival, who is not a member of the household, leads to an absurd shift in the metaphor, so that Cleon and his rival become erastai competing for the affections of an eromenos, hawkers of oracles competing for the attention of a credulous public, athletes in a race for approval and orators competing for the popular vote.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"* The resourceful hero: In Aristophanic comedy, the hero is an independent-minded and self-reliant individual. He has something of the ingenuity of Homer\\'s Odysseus and much of the shrewdness of the farmer idealized in Hesiod\\'s Works and Days, subjected to corrupt leaders and unreliable neighbours. Typically he devises a complicated and highly fanciful escape from an intolerable situation. Clouds Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page VIII Thus Dikaiopolis in The Acharnians contrives a private peace treaty with the Spartans; Bdelucleon in The Wasps turns his own house into a private law court in order to keep his jury-addicted father safely at home; Trygaeus in Peace flies to Olympus on a giant dung beetle to obtain an end to the Peloponnesian War; Pisthetairus in Birds sets off to establish his own colony and becomes instead the ruler of the bird kingdom and a rival to the gods.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* The resourceful cast: The numerous surprising developments in an Aristophanic plot, the changes in scene, and the farcical comings and goings of minor characters towards the end of a play, were managed according to theatrical convention with only three principal actors (a fourth actor, often the leader of the chorus, was permitted to deliver short speeches). Aristophanes: The Frogs and other Plays David Barrett (ed), Penguin Classics 1964, page 17 Songs and addresses to the audience by the Chorus gave the actors hardly enough time off-stage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scene.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'* Complex structure: The action of an Aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal, dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another. The different, structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in English translations.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Dramatic structure===\\\\n\\', \\'The structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows:\\\\n\\', \\'** prologue - an introductory scene with a dialogue and/or soliloquy addressed to the audience, expressed in iambic trimeter and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the play;\\\\n\\', \\'** parodos - the arrival of the chorus, dancing and singing, sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors, often expressed in long lines of tetrameters;\\\\n\\', \\'** symmetrical scenes - passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters, arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length; the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenes:\\\\n\\', \\'*** parabasis - verses through which the Chorus addresses the audience directly, firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end (see the section below Parabasis);\\\\n\\', \\'*** agon - a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play, typically in anapestic tetrameter, though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior arguments; Aristophanes:Wasps D.

The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes\\' own understanding was less formal. Aristophanes: Wasps Dougles MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, page 261 The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis. The early plays (The Acharnians to The Birds) are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them.\\\\n\", \\'* kommation: This is a brief prelude, comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors, such as (Go rejoicing!).\\\\n\\', \"* parabasis proper: This is usually a defense of the author\\'s work and it includes criticism of the audience\\'s attitude.

Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach\\'s notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912â\\\\x80\\\\x9314. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer\\'s analyses, were to be worked on in Africa: but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought. Seaver (1951) p. 44. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On departure for LambarÃ©nÃ© in 1913 he was presented with a pedal piano, a piano with pedal attachments (to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard). Given by the Paris Bach Society, Seaver (1951) p. 63; but Joy (1953) p. 177, says it was given by the Paris Missionary Society. Built especially for the tropics, it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to LambarÃ©nÃ©, packed in a zinc-lined case. At first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art, and fell out of practise: but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of Bach, Mendelssohn, Widor, CÃ©sar Franck, and Max Reger systematically. Seaver (1951) pp. 63â\\\\x80\\\\x9364. It became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on Sunday afternoons. Schweitzer\\\\\\'s pedal piano was still in use at LambarÃ©nÃ© in 1946. Joy (1953) plate facing p. 177. And according to a visitor, Dr. Gaine Cannon, of Balsam Grove, N.C., the old, dilapidated piano-organ was still being played by Dr. Schweitzer in 1962 and stories told of \"his fingers were still lively\" on the old instrument at 88 years of age.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Sir Donald Tovey dedicated his conjectural completion of Bach\\'s Die Kunst der Fuge (Art of the Fugue) to Schweitzer.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"Dr Schweitzer\\'s recordings of organ-music, and his innovative recording technique, are described separately below.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'One of his notable pupils was conductor and composer Hans MÃ¼nch.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Theology==\\\\n\\', \\'Saint-Nicolas, Strasbourg\\\\n\\', \\'In 1899 Schweitzer became a deacon at the church of Saint Nicholas in Strasbourg. In 1900, with the completion of his licentiate in theology, he was ordained as curate, and that year he witnessed the Oberammergau Passion Play. In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of Saint Thomas (from which he had just graduated), and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent. He officiated at the wedding of Theodor Heuss (later the first President of West Germany) on 11 April 1908. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since the mid-1890s Schweitzer had formed the inner resolve that it was needful for him as a Christian to repay to the world something for the happiness which it had given to him, and he determined that he would pursue his younger interests until the age of thirty and then give himself to serving humanity, with Jesus serving as his example.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1906 he published Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung (\"History of Life-of-Jesus research\"). This book, which established his reputation, was first translated into English by William Montgomery and published in 1910 as The Quest of the Historical Jesus. Under this title the book became famous in the English-speaking world. A second German edition was published in 1913, containing theologically significant revisions and expansions: but this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001. This account of the editions of this work is disputed: see talk page. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In The Quest, Schweitzer reviewed all former work on the \"historical Jesus\" back to the late 18th century. He showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors, and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century\\\\\\'s findings. He maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus\\\\\\' own convictions, which reflected late Jewish eschatology. Schweitzer, however, writes: \\\\n\\', \\':The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah, who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God, who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed. He is a figure designed by rationalism, endowed with life by liberalism, and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb. This image has not been destroyed from outside; it has fallen to pieces ... \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Sources===\\\\n\\', \\'Schweitzer found many New Testament references to apparently show that 1st-century Christians believed literally in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the World\\\\\\'s ending, within the lifetime of Jesus\\\\\\'s original followers,. He noted that in the gospel of Mark, Jesus speaks of a \"tribulation\", with his coming in the clouds with great power and glory\" (St Mark), and states when it will happen: \"This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled\" (St Matthew, 24:34) (or, \"have taken place\" (Luke 21:32)): \"All these things shall come upon this generation\" (Matthew 23:36). \"There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom\" (Matthew 16:28) (or, \"until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power\" (Mark 9:1); or, \"till they see the kingdom of God\" (Luke 9:27).)\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Schweitzer notes that St. Paul apparently believed in the immediacy of the \"Second Coming of Jesus\": \"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord\" (1 Thessalonians 4.17). St Paul spoke of the \\\\\\'last times\\\\\\': \"Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none\" (1 Corinthians 7:29); \"God ... Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son\" (Hebrews 1:2). Similarly in St Peter: \"Christ .. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you\" (1 Peter 1:20), and \"But the end of all things is at hand\" (1 Peter 4:7). \"Surely I come quickly\" (Revelation 22:20). (Again, note N.T. Wright, ibid.)\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Schweitzer writes that modern Christians of many kinds deliberately ignore the urgent message (so powerfully proclaimed by Jesus during the 1st century) of an imminent end of the world. Each new generation hopes to be the one to see the world destroyed, another world coming, and the saints governing a new earth. Schweitzer concludes that the 1st century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is both incompatible with, and far removed from, those beliefs later made official by the Roman Emperor Constantine in 325 CE.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Aftermath===\\\\n\\', \\'The publication of The Quest of the Historical Jesus, effectively put a stop to decades of work on the Historical Jesus as a sub-discipline of New Testament studies, what was later called the \"First Quest.\" This work resumed however with the development of the so-called \"Second Quest\", among whose notable exponents was Rudolf Bultmann\\\\\\'s student Ernst KÃ¤semann.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Schweitzer established his reputation further as a New Testament scholar with other theological studies including The Psychiatric Study of Jesus (1911); and his two studies of the apostle Paul, Paul and his Interpreters, and the more complete The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle (1930). This examined the eschatological beliefs of Paul and (through this) the message of the New Testament.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Medicine==\\\\n\\', \\'At the age of 30, in 1905, Schweitzer answered the call of \"The Society of the Evangelist Missions of Paris\" which was looking for a medical doctor. However, the committee of this French Missionary Society was not ready to accept his offer, considering his Lutheran theology to be \"incorrect\". Seaver (1951) p. 40. He could easily have obtained a place in a German Evangelical mission, but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the University as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of a Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labor of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Even in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, The Psychiatric Study of Jesus. In June 1912 he married Helene Bresslau, daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian Harry Bresslau.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"In 1912, now armed with a medical degree, Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society\\'s mission at LambarÃ©nÃ© on the OgoouÃ© river, in what is now Gabon, in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. By concerts and other fund-raising he was ready to equip a small hospital. From the Primeval Forest, Chapter 1. In Spring 1913 he and his wife and son Peter, set off to establish a hospital (Albert Schweitzer Hospital) near an already existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft From the Primeval Forest, Chapter 6. ) upstream from the mouth of the OgoouÃ© at Port Gentil (Cape Lopez) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards LambarÃ©nÃ©.\\\\n\", \\'The watershed of the OgooÃ© occupies most of Gabon. LambarÃ©nÃ© is marked.\\\\n\\', \\'In the first nine months he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In addition to injuries he was often treating severe sandflea and crawcraw sores, framboesia (yaws), tropical eating sores, heart disease, tropical dysentery, tropical malaria, sleeping sickness, leprosy, fevers, strangulated hernias, necrosis, abdominal tumours and chronic constipation and nicotine poisoning, while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings, fetishism and fear of cannibalism among the Mbahouin.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Schweitzer\\'s wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an anaesthetist for surgical operations. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking Galoa (Mpongwe) who first came as a patient. From the Primeval Forest, Chapters 3â\\\\x80\\\\x935. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"When World War I broke out in summer of 1914, Schweitzer and his wife, Germans in a French colony, were put under supervision at LambarÃ©nÃ© by the French military, where Schweitzer continued his work. Albert Schweitzer 1875 â\\\\x80\\\\x93 1965. schweitzer.org (in German) In 1917, exhausted by over four years\\' work and by tropical anaemia, they were taken to Bordeaux and interned first in Garaison and then from March 1918 in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence. In July 1918, after being transferred to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents\\' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on The Philosophy of Civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922 he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in Oxford University, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, The Decay and Restoration of Civilization and Civilization and Ethics. The two remaining volumes, on The World-View of Reverence for Life and a fourth on the Civilized State, were never completed.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1924 he returned without his wife but with an Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann, Nessmann worked with the French Resistance during the Second World War, was captured and executed by the Gestapo in Limoges in 1944. cf Guy Penaud, Dictionaire Biographique de PÃ©rigord, p. 713. ISBN 978-2-86577-214-8 joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6 new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included Germanin and tryparsamide. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'He was there again from 1929 to 1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937 he returned again to LambarÃ©nÃ© and continued working there throughout World War II.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Controversy and criticism==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"===Schweitzer\\'s views===\\\\n\", \\'Schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus\\\\\\' call to become \"fishers of men\" but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European colonizers: Schweitzer, Albert. On the Edge of the Primeval Forest. New York: Macmillan. 1931. p. 115. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Schweitzer was one of colonialism\\'s harshest critics.

For instance, he thought Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances. Edgar Berman quotes Schweitzer as having said in 1960: Berman, Edgar. In Africa With Schweitzer. Far Hills, New Jersey: New Horizon Press. 1986, p. 139. ISBN 0-88282-025-7. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Chinua Achebe has quoted Schweitzer as saying: \"The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother,\" Chinua Achebe. \"An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad\\\\\\'s Heart of Darkness.\" â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the Massachusetts Review. 1977. (c/o North Carolina State University) which Achebe criticized him for, though Achebe seems to acknowledge that Schweitzer\\\\\\'s use of the word \"brother\" at all was, for a European of the early 20th century, an unusual expression of human solidarity between whites and blacks. Schweitzer was more likely speaking in terms of modern civilization than of class relationship of man; this would be consistent with his later statement that \"The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed.\", Quoted by Lachlan Forrow in his Foreword to the 2002 edition of African Notebook and his discussion of the modernization of \"primeval\" societies. Later in life he became more convinced that \"modern civilization\" was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of morality.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The journalist James Cameron visited LambarÃ©nÃ© in 1953 (when Schweitzer was 78) and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities, and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people. Cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time: according to a recent BBC dramatisation, On Monday 7 April 2008 (\"The Walrus and the Terrier\" â\\\\x80\\\\x93 programme outline) BBC Radio 4 broadcast an Afternoon Play \"The Walrus and the Terrier\" by Christopher Ralling concerning Cameron\\\\\\'s visit. he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story, and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposÃ©.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"American journalist John Gunther also visited LambarÃ©nÃ© in the 1950s and reported Schweitzer\\'s patronizing attitude towards Africans. He also noted the lack of Africans trained to be skilled workers. After three decades in Africa Schweitzer still depended on Europe for nurses. By comparison, his contemporary Sir Albert Cook in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Luganda. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Reverence for life==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Schweitzer in 1955\\\\n\\', \\'The keynote of Schweitzer\\\\\\'s personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of Reverence for Life (\"Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben\"). He thought that Western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In the Preface to Civilization and Ethics (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from Descartes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirming optimism of the Age of Enlightenment began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as Will, expressed in the pessimist philosophies from Schopenhauer onward. Scientific materialism (advanced by Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Schweitzer wrote, \"True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness, and this may be formulated as follows: \\\\\\'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live.\\\\\\'\" Civilization and Ethics, Chapter 21, p.253: reprinted as A. Schweitzer, The Philosophy of Civilization, (Prometheus Books, Buffalo 1987), Chapter 26. In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian Brahminic philosophy.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"For Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice-versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.

During his return visits to his home village of Gunsbach, Schweitzer continued to make use of the family house, which after his death became an Archive and Museum to his life and work.

He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old Queen\\'s Hall in London. These records did not satisfy him, the instrument being too harsh. In mid-December 1935 he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All Hallows, Barking-by-the-Tower (London). This fine 1909 Harrison and Harrison organ was blitzed in the War (cf W. Kent, The Lost Treasures of London (Phoenix House 1947), 94â\\\\x80\\\\x9395) but was rebuilt in 1957, see . Then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of Ste AurÃ©lie in Strasbourg, on a mid-18th century organ by Johann Andreas Silbermann (brother of Gottfried), an organ-builder greatly revered by Bach, which had been restored by the Lorraine organ-builder FrÃ©dÃ©ric HÃ¤rpfer shortly before the First World War.

Known as \"The Schweitzer Technique\", it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser.

Human Action, p. 11, \"r. Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction\". Referenced 2011-11-23. It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger, Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, and others. Joseph A. Schumpeter, History of economic analysis, Oxford University Press 1996, ISBN 978-0195105599. Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is referred to as Austrian economics.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value, marginalism in price theory, and the formulation of the economic calculation problem, each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Many economists are critical of the current-day Austrian School and consider its rejection of econometrics, and aggregate macroeconomic analysis to be outside of mainstream economic theory, or \"heterodox.\" Austrians are likewise critical of mainstream economics. Austrian Economics and the Mainstream: View from the Boundary, Roger E. Backhouse Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s, it began to attract renewed academic and public interest starting in the 1970s. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Methodology==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Austrian School theorises that the subjective choices of individuals underlie all economic phenomena. Austrians seek to understand the observed economy by examining the social ramifications of such individual choice. This approach, termed methodological individualism, differs significantly from many other schools of economic thought, which have placed less importance on individual knowledge, time, expectation, and other subjective factors and focused instead on aggregate variables, equilibrium analysis, and the consideration of societal groups rather than individuals. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ludwig von Mises\\\\n\\', \\'In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, many diverse approaches and theoretical orientations have developed among economists whose methodological lineage can be traced back to the early Austrian School. For example, in 1949, Ludwig von Mises codified his version of the subjectivist approach, which he called \"praxeology\", in a book published in English as Human Action. Ludwig von Mises, NationalÃ¶konomie (Geneva: Union, 1940), p. 3; Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, 1998), p. 3. In it, Mises presented an extensive statement of his method, and stated that praxeology could be used to deduce a priori theoretical economic truths. Mises also argued against the use of probabilities in economic models. According to Mises, deductive economic thought experiment can yield conclusions which follow irrefutably from the underlying assumptions and could not be inferred from empirical observation or statistical analysis. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since Mises time, many, but certainly not all, Austrian thinkers have accepted his praxeological approach. Some have adopted alternative methodologies. Bruce J. Caldwell \"Praxeology and its Critics: an Appraisal\" History of Political Economy Fall 1984 16(3): 363â\\\\x80\\\\x93379; For example, Fritz Machlup, Friedrich Hayek, and others, did not take Mises\\\\\\' strong a priori approach to economics. Richard N. Langlois, \"FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF ECONOMICS TO THE ECONOMICS OF KNOWLEDGE: FRITZ MACHLUP ON METHODOLOGY AND ON THE \"KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY\" Research in the History of Economic Thought and Methodology, Volume 3, pp. 225â\\\\x80\\\\x93235 Prof. Ludwig Lachmann, a radical subjectivist, also largely rejected Mises\\\\\\' formulation of Praxeology in favor of the verstehende Methode (interpretive method) articulated by Max Weber. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Economist Paul A. Samuelson has written that most economists believe that economic conclusions reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak. According to Samuelson and economist Bryan Caplan, Mises\\' deductive methodology (also embraced by Murray Rothbard and to a lesser extent by Mises\\' student, Israel Kirzner) was not sufficient in and of itself. Caplan has written that the Austrian challenge to the realism of neoclassical assumptions has helped work towards making those assumptions more plausible. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Starting in the 20th century, various Austrians incorporated models and mathematics into their analysis of the economy. Austrian economist Steven Horwitz argues that Austrian methodology is consistent with macroeconomics and that Austrian macroeconomics can be expressed in terms of microeconomic foundations. Horwitz, Steven: Microfoundations and Macroeconomics: An Austrian Perspective (2000)|Routledge Austrian economist Roger Garrison argues that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of diagrammatic models. http://library.mises.org/books/Roger%20W%20Garrison/Austrian%20Macroeconomics%20A%20Diagrammatical%20Exposition.pdf Garrison, Roger: Austrian Macroeconomics: A Diagrammatical Exposition (1978)|Institute for Humane Studies In 1944, Austrian economist Oskar Morgenstern presented a rigorous schematization of an ordinal utility function (the Von Neumannâ\\\\x80\\\\x93Morgenstern utility theorem) in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.

Opportunity cost is the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative foregone (that is not chosen). It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several mutually exclusive choices. This view is currently held by contemporary economists of all mainstream schools of thought.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing \"the basic relationship between scarcity and choice\". The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Capital and interest===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk\\\\n\\', \\'The Austrian theory of capital and interest was first developed by Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk. He stated that interest rates and profits are determined by two factors, namely, supply and demand in the market for final goods and time preference. BÃ¶hm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales (1889). Translated as Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital with appendices rendered as Further Essays on Capital and Interest. http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/BohmBawerk.html \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"BÃ¶hm-Bawerk\\'s theory was a response to Marx\\'s labor theory of value and capital. BÃ¶hm-Bawerk\\'s theory attacked the viability of the labor theory of value in the light of the transformation problem. His conception of interest countered Marx\\'s exploitation theory. Marx famously argued that capitalists exploit workers by paying them less than the fruits of their labor sell for. Bohm-Bawerk countered this claim by invoking the concept of time preference to demonstrate that everyone values present consumption more than future consumption, and therefore that a difference between the (smaller) salary laborers are paid in the present and the (greater) price for which the goods they produce are later sold need not be exploitative. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"BÃ¶hm-Bawerk\\'s theory equates capital intensity with the degree of roundaboutness of production processes. BÃ¶hm-Bawerk also argued that the law of marginal utility necessarily implies the classical law of costs. Some Austrian economists therefore entirely reject the notion that interest rates are affected by liquidity preference.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Inflation===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Mises believed that money prices and wages will inevitably rise when the supply of money and bank credit is increased. He therefore used the term \"inflation\" to mean an excessive increase of the money supply and not, as is the common usage, to refer to price inflation. In Mises\\\\\\' view, inflation is the result of policies of the government or central bank which result in an increase in the circulating money supply. Ludwig von Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit\", ISBN 978-0-913966-70-9 Mises wrote: In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur. The Theory of Money and Credit, Mises (1912, , p. 272) \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Economist Richard Timberlake criticized von Mises\\' view that inflation must refer to an increase in the money supply. Timberlake noted that economists since the time of John Stuart Mill have recognized the distinction between increases in the money stock and increases in the general level of money prices. Timberlake stated that Mises\\' view has repeatedly been proven false and that statistical measurement of the aggregate price level is necessary in order test the empirical validity of Mises\\' theory. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Economist Paul Krugman has criticized Austrians\\\\\\' views on inflation and the failure to test their views against empirical evidence. In late 2011 he pointed out that the monetary base had tripled in the previous three years, but the average annual inflation rate was only 1.5 percent. There was no \"devastating inflation\" as predicted by Austrians. In late 2012 he chided those who failed to \"let the evidence speak\" when it disproved the Austrian theory of inflation. Krugman wrote: \"If you believe that... expanding credit will simply result in too much money chasing too few goods, and hence a lot of inflation... the failure of high inflation to materialize amounts to a decisive rejection of Austrian model.\" Paul Krugman, Varieties of Error, 2012. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Economic calculation problem===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Friedrich Hayek\\\\n\\', \\'The economic calculation problem refers to a criticism of socialism which was first stated by Max Weber in 1920. Mises subsequently discussed Weber\\\\\\'s idea with his student Friedrich Hayek, who developed it in various works including The Road to Serfdom. F. A. Hayek, (1935), \"The Nature and History of the Problem\" and \"The Present State of the Debate,\" om in F. A. Hayek, ed. Collectivist Economic Planning, pp. 1â\\\\x80\\\\x9340, 201â\\\\x80\\\\x93243. The problem concerns the means by which resources are allocated and distributed in an economy.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Austrian theory emphasizes the organizing power of markets. Hayek stated that market prices reflect information, the totality of which is not known to any single individual, which determines the allocation of resources in an economy. Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and price discovery processes by which individuals act on their personal information, Hayek argued that the decisions of socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge to make optimal decisions. Those who agree with this criticism view it is a refutation of socialism and that it shows that it is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization. The debate rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as The Socialist Calculation Debate. The socialist calculation debate \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Mises argued in a 1920 article \"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the means of production, then no prices could be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not \"objects of exchange,\" unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently. This led him to write \"â\\\\x80¦that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth.\" Economist Bryan Caplan has written that Mises\\\\\\'s has been criticized as overstating the strength of his case, in describing socialism as impossible, rather than that it may need to establish non-market institutions to deal with a source of inefficiency. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Business cycles===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Austrian theory of the business cycle (\"ABCT\") focuses on banks\\\\\\' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by von Mises, who believed that banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes. Mises stated that this led to a misallocation of resources which he called malinvestment.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"According to the theory, malinvestment is induced by banks\\' excessive and unsustainable expansion of credit to businesses. Theory of Money and Credit, Ludwig von Mises, Part III, Part IV Businesses borrow at unsustainably low interest rates and overinvest in capital-intensive production processes, which in turn leads to a diversion of investment from consumer goods industries to capital goods industries. Austrians contend that this shift is unsustainable and must eventually be reversed, and that the re-adjustment process will be more violent and disruptive the longer the putative malinvestment in capital goods industries continues.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"According to the Austrian view, the proportion of income allocated to consumption rather than saving is determined by the interest rate and people\\'s time preference, which is the degree to which they prefer present to future satisfactions. According to this view, the pure interest rate is determined by the time preferences of the individuals in society. If the market rate of interest offered by banks is set lower than this, business borrowing will be excessive and will be allocated to malinvestment. Theory of Money and Credit, Ludwig von Mises, Part II \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"Newly extended credit thus malinvested will circulate from the business borrowers to the factors of production: landowners, capital goods producers, and capital goods workers. Austrians state that, because individuals\\' time preferences have not changed, the market will tend to reestablish the old proportions between current and future production. Depositors will tend to remove cash from the banking system and spend it (not save it), banks will then ask their borrowers for repayment, and the excessive capital goods will be liquidated at lower prices to retire the now-unprofitable loans. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'====Role of government disputed====\\\\n\\', \"According to Mises, central banks enable the commercial banks to fund loans at artificially low interest rates, thereby inducing an unsustainable expansion of bank credit and impeding any subsequent contraction. The Mystery of Banking, Murray Rothbard, 1983 Theory of Money and Credit, Ludwig von Mises, Part III, Part IV America\\'s Great Depression, Murray Rothbard Friedrich Hayek disagreed. Hayek did not favor laissez-faire in banking and said that a freely competitive banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, mimicking the effects which Rothbard attributed to central bank policy. Hayek stated that the need for central banking control was inescapable. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'====Criticism====\\\\n\\', \\'Most research regarding the theory finds that it is inconsistent with empirical evidence. Economists such as Gordon Tullock, Bryan Caplan, Milton Friedman, and Paul Krugman have said that they regard the theory as incorrect. Austrian economist Ludwig Lachmann noted that the Austrian theory was rejected during the 1930s:\\\\n\\', \\'The promise of an Austrian theory of the trade cycle, which might also serve to explain the severity of the Great Depression, a feature of the early 1930s that provided the background for Hayekâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s successful appearance on the London scene, soon proved deceptive. Three giants â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Keynes, Knight and Sraffa â\\\\x80\\\\x93 turned against the hapless Austrians who, in the middle of that black decade, thus had to do battle on three fronts. Naturally it proved a task beyond their strength. Ludwig M. Lachmann, in The Market as an Economic Process (Oxford, 1986), p. ix \\\\n\\', \\'In 1969, Milton Friedman argued that the theory is not consistent with empirical evidence Friedman, Milton. \"The Monetary Studies of the National Bureau, 44th Annual Report\". The Optimal Quantity of Money and Other Essays. Chicago: Aldine. pp. 261â\\\\x80\\\\x93284. and using newer data in 1993 reached the same conclusion. Friedman, Milton. \"The \\\\\\'Plucking Model\\\\\\' of Business Fluctuations Revisited\". Economic Inquiry: 171â\\\\x80\\\\x93177. In 1986, Austrian economist Roger Garrison reviewed Hayek\\\\\\'s development of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory and discussed the factors that have sustained interest in the theory despite its longtime rejection by mainstream economics. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==History==\\\\n\\', \\'Jean-Baptiste Say\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Origin of the name Austrian school===\\\\n\\', \\'The School owes its name to members of the German Historical school of economics, who argued against the Austrians during the Methodenstreit (\"methodology struggle\"), in which the Austrians defended the role of theory in economics as distinct from the study or compilation of historical circumstance. In 1883, Menger published Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics, which attacked the methods of the Historical school. Gustav von Schmoller, a leader of the Historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term \"Austrian School\" in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial. \"Mengerâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s approach â\\\\x80\\\\x93 haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, as merely â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAustrian,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d the origin of that label â\\\\x80\\\\x93 led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in Europe and, later, in the United States.\" Peter G.

Hoselitz, 1976; Ludwig von Mises Institute, Alabama; 2007; ISBN 978-1-933550-12-1 The label endured and was adopted by the adherents themselves. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===First Wave===\\\\n\\', \\'Carl Menger\\\\n\\', \\'The school originated in Vienna, in the Austrian Empire. Carl Menger\\\\\\'s 1871 book, Principles of Economics, is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of marginal utility. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics. While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger\\\\\\'s work, which came to be known as the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cPsychological School,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d â\\\\x80\\\\x9cVienna School,â\\\\x80\\\\x9d or â\\\\x80\\\\x9cAustrian School.â\\\\x80\\\\x9d Israel M.

These three economists became what is known as the \"first wave\" of the Austrian School. BÃ¶hm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of Karl Marx in the 1880s and 1890s, as was part of the Austrians\\\\\\' participation in the late 19th Century Methodenstreit, during which they attacked the Hegelian doctrines of the Historical School.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Early Twentieth Century in Vienna===\\\\n\\', \\'Several important Austrian economists trained at the University of Vienna in the 1920s and later participated in the private seminar of von Mises. These included Gottfried Haberler, http://mises.org/page/1452/Biography-of-Gottfried-Haberler-19011995 Friedrich Hayek, Fritz Machlup, Karl Menger (son of Carl Menger), http://www.iit.edu/csl/am/about/menger/about.shtml Oskar Morgenstern, http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/morgenst/ Paul Rosenstein-Rodan http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=COLL+MISC+0324 Archive at London School of Economics \\\\n\\', \\'Abraham Wald, among others.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Later Twentieth century===\\\\n\\', \\'Israel Kirzner\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'By the mid-1930s, most economists had embraced what they considered the important contributions of the early Austrians. After World War II, Austrian economics was disregarded or derided by most economists because it rejected mathematical and statistical methods in the study of economics. \"Austrian economics and the mainstream: View from the boundary\" by Roger E. Backhouse, $34 to view Fritz Machlup quoted Hayek\\\\\\'s statement, \"the greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought.\" http://mises.org/daily/1700/Ludwig-von-Mises-A-Scholar-Who-Would-Not-Compromise Homage to Mises by Fritz Machlup 1981 Mises\\\\\\' student, Israel Kirzner recalled that in 1954, when Kirzner was pursuing his PhD, there was no separate Austrian School as such. When Kirzner was deciding which graduate school to attend, Mises had advised him to accept an offer of admission at Johns Hopkins because it was a prestigious university and Fritz Machlup taught there. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'After 1940, Austrian economics can be divided into two schools of economic thought, and the school \"split\" to some degree in the late 20th century. One camp of Austrians, exemplified by Mises, regards neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed; the other camp, exemplified by Friedrich Hayek, accepts a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy. http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae7_1_3.pdf \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Henry Hazlitt wrote economics columns and editorials for a number of publications and wrote many books on the topic of Austrian economics from the 1930s to the 1980s. Hazlitt\\\\\\'s thinking was influenced by Mises. His book Economics in One Lesson (1946) sold over a million copies, and he is also known for The Failure of the \"New Economics\" (1959), a line-by-line critique of John Maynard Keynes\\\\\\'s General Theory. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"The reputation of the Austrian School rose in the late-20th century due in part to the work of Israel Kirzner and Ludwig Lachmann at New York University, and to renewed public awareness of the work of Hayek after he won the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Hayek\\'s work was influential in the revival of laissez-faire thought in the 20th century. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Split among contemporary Austrians===\\\\n\\', \\'According to economist Bryan Caplan, by the late twentieth century, a split had developed among those who self-identify with the Austrian School. One group, building on the work of Hayek, follows the broad framework of mainstream neoclassical economics, including its use of mathematical models and general equilibrium, and merely brings a critical perspective to mainstream methodology influenced by the Austrian notions such as the economic calculation problem and the independent role of logical reasoning in developing economic theory. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Murray Rothbard\\\\n\\', \\'A second group, following Mises and Rothbard, rejects the neoclassical theories of consumer and welfare economics, dismisses empirical methods and mathematical and statistical models as inapplicable to economic science, and asserts that economic theory went entirely astray in the twentieth century; they offer the Misesian view as a radical alternative paradigm to mainstream theory. Caplan wrote that if \"Mises and Rothbard are right, then economics is wrong; but if Hayek is right, then mainstream economics merely needs to adjust its focus.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Economist Leland Yeager discussed the late twentieth century rift and referred to a discussion written by Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Joseph Salerno, and others in which they attack and disparage Hayek. \"To try to drive a wedge between Mises and Hayek on role of knowledge in economic calculation, especially to the disparagement of Hayek, is unfair to these two great men, unfaithful to the history of economic thought\" and went on to call the rift subversive to economic analysis and the historical understanding of the fall of Eastern European communism. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In a 1999 book published by the Mises Institute, Hans-Hermann Hoppe asserted that Murray Rothbard was the leader of the \"mainstream within Austrian Economics\" and contrasted Rothbard with Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek, whom he identified as a British empiricist and an opponent of the thought of Mises and Rothbard. Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and BÃ¶hm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard.\\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'Economists of the Hayekian view are affiliated with the Cato Institute, George Mason University, and New York University, among other institutions.

For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected to the use of cardinal utility in microeconomic theory. Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results are derived for any monotonic transformation of an ordinal utility function, and do not entail cardinal utility. The result is that conclusions about utility preferences hold no matter what values are assigned to them.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Economist Paul Krugman has stated that because Austrians do not use \"explicit models\" they are unaware of holes in their own thinking.

Furthermore, many supporters of using models of market behavior to analyze and test economic theory argue that economists have developed numerous experiments that elicit useful information about individual preferences. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Economist Leland Yeager rejects many favorite views of the Misesian group of Austrians, in particular, \"These include the specifics of their business-cycle theory, ultra-subjectivism in value theory and particularly in interest-rate theory, their insistence on unidirectional causality rather than general interdependence, and their fondness for methodological brooding, pointless profundities, and verbal gymnastics. Provoked by mainstream abuses of mathematics, including the frequent merely decorative and pretentious use of symbols, some Austrians have wanted to ban mathematics from economics. But is it not arrogant for someone who does not see how to use certain techniques constructively to suppose that no one else will ever see how either? These Austrians should remember how, in other contexts, they emphasize the openness of the future and scope for novelty.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Business cycle theory===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'According to John Quiggin, most economists believe that the Austrian business cycle theory is incorrect because of its incompleteness and other problems.

Problems with Austrian Business Cycle Theory Bryan Caplan writes: \"Why does Rothbard think businessmen are so incompetent at forecasting government policy? He credits them with entrepreneurial foresight about all market-generated conditions, but curiously finds them unable to forecast government policy, or even to avoid falling prey to simple accounting illusions generated by inflation and deflation... Particularly in interventionist economies, it would seem that natural selection would weed out businesspeople with such a gigantic blind spot.\" \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Economist Paul Krugman has argued that the theory cannot explain changes in unemployment over the business cycle. Austrian business cycle theory postulates that business cycles are caused by the misallocation of resources from consumption to investment during \"booms\", and out of investment during \"busts\". Krugman argues that because total spending is equal to total income in an economy, the theory implies that the reallocation of resources during \"busts\" would increase employment in consumption industries, whereas in reality, spending declines in all sectors of an economy during recessions. He also argues that according to the theory the initial \"booms\" would also cause resource reallocation, which implies an increase in unemployment during booms as well. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In response, historian David Gordon argues that Krugman\\\\\\'s analysis misrepresents Austrian theory.

Garrison has also stated that capital allocated to investment goods cannot always be redeployed to create consumption goods. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Economist Jeffery Hummel is critical of Hayek\\'s explanation of labor asymmetry in booms and busts. He argues that Hayek makes peculiar assumptions about demand curves for labor in his explanation of how a decrease in investment spending creates unemployment. He also argues that the labor asymmetry can be explained in terms of a change in real wages, but this explanation fails to explain the business cycle in terms of resource allocation. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Milton Friedman objected to the policy implications of the theory, stating the following in a 1998 interview:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm.

In particular, he notes that investment spending remained positive in all recessions where there are data, except for the Great Depression. He argues that this casts doubt on the notion that recessions are caused by a reallocation of resources from industrial production to consumption, since he argues that the Austrian business cycle theory implies that net investment should be below zero during recessions. In response, Austrian economist Walter Block argues that the misallocation during booms does not preclude the possibility of demand increasing overall. http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/30/rp_30_4.pdf \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In 1969, economist Milton Friedman, after examining the history of business cycles in the U.S., concluded that \"The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence.

Signs and symptoms for those close to the skin include: redness, pain, warmth, and swelling that when pressed feels like it is fluid filled. The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling. Carbuncles and furuncles are types of abscess that often involves hair follicles with carbuncles being larger. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'They are usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage. There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics in most people who are otherwise healthy. A small amount of evidence supports not packing with gauze the cavity that remains after drainage. Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increase the risk of the abscess returning. Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as 65% in this population. In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 for the disease. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Signs and symptoms==\\\\n\\', \\'An abscess\\\\n\\', \\'The main symptoms and signs of an abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules (boils) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys and tonsils. Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death (gangrene). Abscesses in most parts of the body rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated at the first suspicion of an abscess.\\\\n\\', \\'An abscess could potentially be fatal (although this is rare) if it compresses vital structures such as the trachea in the context of a deep neck abscess.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'If superficial, abscesses may be fluctuant when palpated. This is a wave-like motion which is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Causes==\\\\n\\', \\'Risk factors for abscess formation include intravenous drug use. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'They are usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Rarely parasites can causes abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Specific parasites known to do this include: dracunculiasis and myiasis. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Perianal abscess===\\\\n\\', \\'Surgery of the anal fistula to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery. There is no evidence that fecal incontinence is a consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Perianal abscesses can be seen in patients with for example inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn\\'s disease) or diabetes. Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication. This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess. This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the anus which grows larger and more painful with time. Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and debridement or lancing.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Differential===\\\\n\\', \\'Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include: cellulitis, a sebaceous cyst and necrotising fasciitis. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Pathophysiology==\\\\n\\', \\'An diagram of an abscess\\\\n\\', \\'An abscess is a defensive reaction of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The organisms or foreign materials kill the local cells, resulting in the release of cytokines. The cytokines trigger an inflammatory response, which draws large numbers of white blood cells to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Diagnosis==\\\\n\\', \\'thumb\\\\n\\', \\'Abscesses must be differentiated from empyemas, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'For those with a history of intravenous drug use, an X-ray is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present. In this population if there is also a fever present infectious endocarditis should be considered. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Treatment==\\\\n\\', \\'The standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining. There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics in most cases. A small amount of evidence did not find benefit from packing the abscess with gauze. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Incision and drainage===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Abscess five days after incision and drainage.\\\\n\\', \\'Abscess following curettage.\\\\n\\', \\'The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal. If foreign objects are not the cause, a doctor will incise and drain the abscess and prescribe painkillers and possibly antibiotics. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Surgical drainage of the abscess (e.g., lancing) is usually indicated once the abscess has developed from a harder serous inflammation to a softer pus stage.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort. The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the respiratory tract. Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=== Antibiotics ===\\\\n\\', \\'Most people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics. Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of cellulitis, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing immunosuppression. People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics. If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin is used. The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levels.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Culturing the wound is not needed if standard followup care can be provided after the incision and drainage. Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Packing===\\\\n\\', \\'In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, bring more rapid healing, or lead to fewer physician visits. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Primary closure===\\\\n\\', \\'Closing an abscess right after draining it rather than leaving it open appears to speed healing without increase the risk of the abscess returning. This may not apply to anorectal abscesses. While they heal faster there maybe a higher rate of recurrence than those left open. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Prognosis==\\\\n\\', \\'Even without treatment they rarely result in death as they will naturally burst through the skin. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Epidemiology==\\\\n\\', \\'Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as 65% in this population. In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess.

Hewit, \"Puebloan Culture\", University of Northern Colorado \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Etymology==\\\\n\\', \\'The name Pueblo originated with the Spanish explorers, who referred to their particular style of villages. It means \"village\" in Spanish. The Navajo people, who now reside in parts of former Pueblo territory, referred to the ancient people as , an exonym meaning \"ancestors of our enemies\" although it is now used in the term \"ancient people, or \"ancient ones.\" \"Anasazi.\" U*X*L Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes.

The others are the Mogollon, Hohokam and Patayan. In relation to neighboring cultures, the Ancient Pueblo occupied the northeast quadrant of the area. The Anasazi or \"Ancient Pueblo\", from CP-LUHNA, Northern Arizona University The Ancient Pueblo homeland centers on the Colorado Plateau, but extends from central New Mexico on the east to southern Nevada on the west. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Areas of southern Nevada, Utah and Colorado form a loose northern boundary, while the southern edge is defined by the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers in Arizona and the Rio Puerco and Rio Grande in New Mexico. Structures and other evidence of Ancient Pueblo culture has been found extending east onto the American Great Plains, in areas near the Cimarron and Pecos rivers and in the Galisteo Basin.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Terrain and resources within this expansive region vary greatly. The plateau regions have high elevations ranging from 4500 to 8500 ft. Extensive horizontal mesas are capped by sedimentary formations and support woodlands of junipers, pinon, and ponderosa pines, each favoring different elevations. Wind and water erosion have created steep-walled canyons, and sculpted windows and bridges out of the sandstone landscape. In areas where resistant strata (sedimentary rock layers), such as sandstone or limestone, overlie more easily eroded strata such as shale, rock overhangs formed. The Ancient Pueblo favored building under such overhangs for shelters and building sites. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'All areas of the Ancient Pueblo homeland suffered from periods of drought, and wind and water erosion. Summer rains could be undependable and often arrived as destructive thunderstorms. While the amount of winter snowfall varied greatly, the Ancient Pueblo depended on the snow for most of their water. Snow melt allowed the germination of seeds, both wild and cultivated, in the spring. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Where sandstone layers overlay shale, snow melt could accumulate and create seeps and springs, which the Ancient Pueblo used as water sources. Snow also fed the smaller, more predictable tributaries, such as the Chinle, Animas, Jemez and Taos rivers. The larger rivers were less important to the ancient culture, as smaller streams were more easily diverted or controlled for irrigation.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Pueblo Bonito, the largest of the Chacoan Great Houses, stands at the foot of Chaco Canyon\\'s northern rim.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Cultural characteristics ==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Ancient Pueblo culture is perhaps best known for the stone and earth dwellings built along cliff walls, particularly during the Pueblo II and Pueblo III eras. The best-preserved examples of the stone dwellings are in National Parks (USA), such as Navajo National Monument, Chaco Canyon or Chaco Culture National Historical Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Aztec Ruins National Monument, Bandelier National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, and Canyon de Chelly National Monument. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'These villages, called pueblos by Spanish settlers, were often only accessible by rope or through rock climbing. These astonishing building achievements had more modest beginnings. The first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pit-house, a common feature in the Basketmaker periods.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ancestral Puebloans are also known for their pottery. In general, pottery was used for cooking or storage in the region was unpainted gray, either smooth or textured. In \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Mimbres Bowl with rabbit, c. AD 1000â\\\\x80\\\\x931150\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'the northern or \"Anasazi\" portion of the Ancestral Pueblo world, from about 500 to 1300 CE, the most common decorated pottery had black painted designs on white or light gray backgrounds. Decoration is characterized by fine hatching, and contrasting colors are produced by the use of mineral-based paint on a chalky background. Cordell, pp. 98 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Some tall cylinders are considered ceremonial vessels, while narrow-necked jars may have been used for liquids. Ware in the southern portion of the region, particularly after 1150 CE, is characterized by heavier black-line decoration and the use of carbon-based colorants. In northern New Mexico, the local \"black on white\" tradition, the Rio Grande white wares, continued well after 1300 CE. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Changes in pottery composition, structure and decoration are signals of social change in the archaeological record. This is particularly true as the peoples of the American Southwest began to leave their traditional homes and migrate south. According to archaeologists Patricia Crown and Steadman Upham, the appearance of the bright colors on Salada Polychromes in the 14th century may reflect religious or political alliances on a regional level. Late 14th and 15th century pottery from central Arizona, widely traded in the region, has colors and designs which may derive from earlier ware by both Ancestral Pueblo and Mogollon peoples. Cordell, p. 142-143 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Tonto polychrome bowl, from Tonto National Monument \\\\n\\', \\'The Ancestral Puebloans also created many petroglyphs and pictographs.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Architecture - Pueblo complexes and Great Houses ==\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Ancestral Pueblo people crafted a unique architecture with planned community spaces. The ancient population centers such as Chaco Canyon (outside Crownpoint, New Mexico), Mesa Verde (near Cortez, Colorado), and Bandelier National Monument (near Los Alamos, New Mexico) for which the Ancestral Pueblo peoples are renowned, consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local material, or were carved into the sides of canyon walls. Each were influenced by themselves and design details from other cultures as far away as contemporary Mexico. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In their day, these ancient towns and cities were usually multi-storied and multi-purposed buildings surrounding open plazas and viewsheds and were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Pueblo peoples. These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadways.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Multistory dwellings at Bandelier. Rock wall foundations and beam holes and \"cavates\" carved into volcanic tuff remain from upper floors\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Constructed well before 1492 CE, these Ancestral Pueblo towns and villages in the Southwestern United States were located in various defensive positions, for example, on high steep mesas such as at Mesa Verde or present-day Acoma Pueblo, called the \"Sky City\", in New Mexico. Earlier than 900 CE progressing past the 13th century, the population complexes were a major center of culture for the Ancient Pueblo Peoples. In Chaco Canyon, Chacoan developers quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling 15 major complexes which remained the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed, with the Sun Dagger petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction. Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a 50-year drought in 1130. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=== Great Houses ===\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Immense complexes known as \"Great Houses\" embodied worship at Chaco. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms. Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Ancestral Pueblo works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Casa Rinconada, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico \\\\n\\', \\'Doorways, Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Houses generally faced the south, and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo\\'s rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ceremonial structures known as kivas were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small kiva was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized Great Kiva, each up to 63 ft in diameter. T-shaped doorways and stone lintels marked all Chacoan kivas. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Though simple and compound walls were often used, Great Houses were primarily constructed of core-and-veneer walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with rubble, forming the wall\\'s core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding mud. These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauledâ\\\\x80\\\\x94on footâ\\\\x80\\\\x94from mountain ranges up to 70 mi away. Kantner, John (2004). \"Ancient Puebloan Southwest\", pp. 161-66 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Ceremonial infrastructureâ\\\\x80\\\\x93Great North Road: the thirty foot wide highway ==\\\\n\\', \\'One of the most notable aspects of Ancestral Puebloan infrastructure is at Chaco Canyon and is the Chaco Road, a system of roads radiating out from many great house sites such as Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl and Una Vida, and leading towards small outlier sites and natural features within and beyond the canyon limits.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Through satellite images and ground investigations, archaeologists have detected at least 8 main roads that together run for more than 180 miles (ca 300 km), and are more than 30 feet (10 m) wide. These were excavated into a smooth leveled surface in the bedrock or created through the removal of vegetation and soil. The Ancestral Pueblo residents of Chaco Canyon cut large ramps and stairways into the cliff rock to connect the roadways on the ridgetops of the canyon to the sites on the valley bottoms.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The largest roads, constructed at the same time as many of the great house sites (between 1000 and 1125 CE), are: the Great North Road, the South Road, the Coyote Canyon Road, the Chacra Face Road, Ahshislepah Road, Mexican Springs Road, the West Road and the shorter Pintado-Chaco Road. Simple structures like berms and walls are found sometimes aligned along the courses of the roads. Also, some tracts of the roads lead to natural features such as springs, lakes, mountain tops and pinnacles. \"Chacoan Roads.\" National Park Service. Retrieved 4 June 2012. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The Great North Road===\\\\n\\', \"The longest and most famous of these roads is the Great North Road. The Great North Road originates from different routes close to Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. These roads converge at Pueblo Alto and from there lead north beyond the Canyon limits. There are no communities along the road\\'s course, apart from small, isolated structures.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Archaeological interpretations of the Chaco road system are divided between an economic purpose and a symbolic, ideological role linked to ancestral Puebloan beliefs.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"The system was first discovered at the end of the 19th century, and first excavated and studied in the 1970s. Archaeologists suggested that the road\\'s main purpose was to transport local and exotic goods inside and outside the canyon. Someone also suggested that these large roads were used to quickly move an army from the canyon to the outlier communities, a purpose similar to the road systems known for the Roman empire. This last scenario has long been discarded because of the lack of any evidence of a permanent army.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The economic purpose of the Chaco road system is shown by the presence of luxury items at Pueblo Bonito and elsewhere in the canyon. Items such as macaws, turquoise, marine shells, and imported vessels prove the long-distance commercial relations Chaco had with other regions. A further suggestion is that the widespread use of timber in Chacoan constructionsâ\\\\x80\\\\x94a resource not locally availableâ\\\\x80\\\\x94needed a large and easy transportation system. Through analysis of various strontium isotopes, archaeologists have realized that much of the timber that composes Chacoan construction came from a number of distant mountain ranges, indicative also of the Chaco Road\\\\\\'s economic significance. English, Nathan B., Julio L. Betancourt, Jeffrey S. Dean, andJay Quade. \"Strontium isotopes reveal distant sources of architectural timber in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 15 Aug 2001. Retrieved 4 June 2012. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'=== Ancient Religion and Road Building ===\\\\n\\', \\'Prehistoric roads and great houses in the San Juan Basin \\\\n\\', \\'Other archaeologists think instead that the main purpose of the road system was a religious one, providing pathways for periodic pilgrimages and facilitating regional gatherings for seasonal ceremonies. Furthermore, considering that some of these roads seem to go nowhere, experts suggest that they can be linkedâ\\\\x80\\\\x94especially the Great North Roadâ\\\\x80\\\\x94to astronomical observations, solstice marking, and agricultural cycles.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'This religious explanation is supported by modern Pueblo beliefs about a North Road leading to their place of origin and along which the spirits of the dead travel. According to modern pueblo people, this road represents the connection to the shipapu, the place of emergence of the ancestors or a dimensional doorway. During their journey from the shipapu to the world of the living, the spirits stop along the road and eat the food left for them by the living.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Astronomy certainly played an important role in Chaco culture, as it is visible in the north-south axis alignment of many ceremonial structures. The main buildings at Pueblo Bonito, for example, are arranged according to this direction and probably served as central places for ceremonial journeys across the landscape.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Sparse concentrations of ceramic fragments along the North Road have been related to some sort of ritual activities carried out along the roadway. Isolated structures located on the roadsides as well as on top of the canyon cliffs and ridge crests have been interpreted as shrines related to these activities.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Finally, features such as long linear grooves were cut into the bedrock along certain roads which do not seem to point to a specific direction. It has been proposed that these were part of pilgrimage paths followed during ritual ceremonies.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Archaeologists agree that the purpose of this road system may have changed through time and that the Chaco Road system probably functioned for both economic and ideological reasons. Its significance for archaeology lies in the possibility to understand the rich and sophisticated cultural expression of Ancestral Pueblo societies.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'== Cliff Palace communities and design ==\\\\n\\', \\'Plan of entire Spruce Tree House from above, cut from Laser scan data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership\\\\n\\', \\'Laser scan section of the four-story Square Tower House, data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership\\\\n\\', \"Section view of Kiva A in Mesa Verde\\'s Fire Temple, cut from laser scan data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership. Since Fire Temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of the cliff alcove in which it was built, it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures defined as kivas\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Throughout the southwest Ancient Puebloan region and at Mesa Verde, the best known site for these large number of well preserved cliff dwellings, housing, defensive and storage complexes were built in shallow caves and under rock overhangs along canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Specific constructions had many similarities, but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'While much of the construction in these sites conforms to common Pueblo architectural forms, including Kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built right up against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could and no areas were considered off-limits to construction. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Not all of the people in the region lived in cliff dwellings; many colonized the canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. Decorative motifs for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both cliff dwellings and non-, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, such as Stephen Lekson (1999), as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chaco Canyon elite system, which had seemingly collapsed around a century before. Lekson, Stephen (1999). \"The Chaco Meridian: centers of Political Power in the Ancient Southwest\". Walnut Creek, Altamira Press Other researchers see these motifs as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system. Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, \"The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis\" paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'==Cultural development==\\\\n\\', \\'===Origins===\\\\n\\', \\'The period from 700-1130 CE (Pueblo I and II Eras) saw a rapid increase in population due to consistent and regular rainfall patterns. Studies of skeletal remains show that this growth was due to increased fertility rather than decreased mortality. However, this tenfold increase in population over the course of a few generations could not be achieved by increased birthrate alone; likely it also involved migrations of peoples from surrounding areas. Innovations such as pottery, food storage, and agriculture enabled this rapid growth. Over several decades, the Ancient Pueblo culture spread across the landscape. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ancient Pueblo culture has been divided into three main areas or branches, based on geographical location: \\\\n\\', \\'* Chaco Canyon (northwest New Mexico)\\\\n\\', \\'* Kayenta (northeast Arizona), and\\\\n\\', \\'* Northern San Juan (Mesa Verde and Hovenweep National Monument) (southwest Colorado and southeastern Utah).\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Modern Pueblo oral traditions hold that the ancient Pueblo people originated from sipapu, where they emerged from the underworld. For unknown ages, they were led by chiefs and guided by spirits as they completed vast migrations throughout the continent of North America. They settled first in the ancient Pueblo areas for a few hundred years before moving to their present locations.\\\\n\\']'"

literature and America Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation Barry Gifford ed As Ever The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg  Neal Cassady In the first chapter of his  novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady Kerouac saw them as the dark Ginsberg and light Cassady side of their New Vision a perception stemming partly from Ginsbergs association with communism of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party Kerouac named him Carlo Marx in On the Road This was a source of strain in their relationship n n Also in New York Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar Corso recently released from prison was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso who was straight but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corsos poems realizing Corso was spiritually gifted Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle In their first meeting at the Pony Stable Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window Amazingly the woman happened to be Ginsbergs girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment There the woman proposed sex with Corso who was still very young and fled in fear Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators n n Shortly after this period in Ginsbergs life he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generations period of development As a Barnard student Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and TS Eliot when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir among other Beat players As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona While at Barnard Cowen earned the nickname Beat Alice as she had joined a small group of antiestablishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books including Minor Characters and Come and Join the Dance which expressed the two womens experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community Through his association with Elise Cowen Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend Carl Solomon to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem Howl This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to  and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that timen n The Blake Visionn In  in an apartment in Harlem Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake later referred to as his Blake vision At first Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah Sunflower The Sick Rose and Little Girl Lost also described by Ginsberg as voice of the ancient of days The experience lasted several days Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe He looked at latticework on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also or rather that the sky was the hand that crafted itself He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs Ginsberg stated living blue hand itself xistence itself was God and  felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universen n San Francisco Renaissancen In  in San Francisco Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky xx with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner n n Also in San Francisco Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense Ginsbergs mentor William Carlos Williams wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead Kenneth Rexroth who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene There Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College Gary Snyder Philip Whalen and Lew Welch In  along with poets John Kelly Bob Kaufman A D Winans and William Margolis Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazinen n Wally Hedrick xx a painter and cofounder of the Six Gallery xx approached Ginsberg in mid and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery At first Ginsberg refused but once he had written a rough draft of Howl he changed his fucking mind as he put it Ginsberg advertised the event as Six Poets at the Six Gallery One of the most important events in Beat mythos known simply as The Six Gallery reading took place on October   The event in essence brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation Of more personal significance to Ginsberg the reading that night included the first public presentation of Howl a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him An account of that night can be found in Kerouacs novel The Dharma Bums describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine and Ginsberg reading passionately drunken with arms outstretchedn n Ginsbergs principal work Howl is well known for its opening line I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked Howl was considered scandalous at the time of its publication because of the rawness of its language Shortly after its  publication by San Franciscos City Lights Bookstore it was banned for obscenity The ban became a cause clbre among defenders of the First Amendment and was later lifted after Judge Clayton W Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value Ginsberg and Shig Murao the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling Howl became lifelong friends Ball Gordon Howl and Other Victories A friend remembers City Lights Shig Murao San Francisco Chronicle  n n Biographical references in Howln Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography like Kerouacs Duluoz Legend Howl is not only a biography of Ginsbergs experiences before  but also a history of the Beat Generation Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of Howl were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother Though Kaddish deals more explicitly with his mother so explicitly that a linebyline analysis would be simultaneously overexhaustive and relatively unrevealing Howl in many ways is driven by the same emotions Howl chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergxxs life He begins the poem with xxcI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessxxd which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon immortalizing them into American literature This madness was the xxcangry fixxxd that society needed to functionxxmadness was its disease In the poem Ginsberg focused on xxcCarl Solomon Ixxm with you in Rocklandxxd and thus turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his xxcstraightjacketxxd Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation and his own political views Howl his most famous poem is still perhaps the best place to startn n To Paris and the Beat Hoteln In  Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco After a spell in Morocco he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at  rue GtleCoeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel They were soon joined by Burroughs and others It was a productive creative time for all of them There Ginsberg finished his epic poem Kaddish Corso composed Bomb and Marriage and Burroughs with help from Ginsberg and Corso put together Naked Lunch from previous writings This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman who moved in at about the same time and took pictures constantly of the residents of the hotel until it closed in  During xx Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta Also during this time he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in  Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably Pupul Jayakar who helped him escape imprisonment during the

Peter Orlovsky Photo taken in n Though the term Beat is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends Corso Orlovsky Kerouac Burroughs etc the term Beat Generation has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late s and early s A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name Beat Generation Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes Some of these friends include David Amram Bob Kaufman LeRoi Jones before he became Amiri Baraka who after reading Howl wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper Diane DiPrima Jim Cohn poets

culture Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time including Lady Chatterleyxxs Lover The sex that Ginsberg painted did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples or even long time lovers Instead Ginsberg portrayed casual sex and used this to comment on the emptiness and constant hunger that could exist in the lives of Americans For example in Howl Ginsberg praises the man who sweetened the snatches of a million girls Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language pointing out the man who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup In his poetry Ginsberg also discussed the thentaboo topic of homosexuality The explicit sexual language that filled Howl eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues

people In  he discovered within himself mountains of homosexuality He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing Peter Orlovsky his lifelong companion as his spouse in his Whos Who entry Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only

CIA drug traffickingn n Through his own drug use and the drug use of his friends and associates Ginsberg became more and more preoccupied with the American governments relationship to drug use within and outside the nation He worked closely with Alfred W McCoy who was writing The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia which tracked the history of the American governments involvement in illegal opium dealing around the world This would affirm Ginsbergs suspicions that the government and the CIA were involved in drug trafficking In addition to working with McCoy Ginsberg personally confronted Richard Helms the director of the CIA in the s but he was simply brushed off as being full of beans Allen wrote many essays and articles researching and compiling evidence of CIAs involvement but it would take ten years and the publication of McCoys book in  before anyone took him seriously In  Allen received a note from the chief editor of the New York Times apologizing for not taking his

Workn Though early on Ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer he wrote poetry for most of his life Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol William Blake His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously Though he took odd jobs to support himself in  upon the advice of a psychiatrist Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry Soon after he wrote Howl the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life Later in life Ginsberg entered academia teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at Brooklyn College from  until his deathn n Inspiration from friendsn Since Ginsbergs poetry is intensely personal and since much of the vitality of those associated with the beat generation comes from mutual inspiration much credit for style inspiration and content can be given to Ginsbergs friendsn n Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouacs concept of spontaneous prose He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac For example when Kerouac saw the first draft of Howl he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil transposing negro and angry in the first line for example Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsbergs insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry n n The inspiration for Howl was Ginsbergs friend Carl Solomon and Howl is dedicated to Solomon whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud who suffered bouts of depression Solomon wanted to commit suicide but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy The institution refused giving him many forms of therapy including electroshock therapy Much of the final section of the first part of Howl is a description of thisn n Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of Moloch Moloch to whom the second section is addressed is a Levantine god to whom children were sacrificed Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem Thou Shalt Not Kill a poem about the death of one of Ginsbergs heroes Dylan Thomas Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsbergs Jewish background are not infrequent in his work Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull he took it as a symbol of the city not specifically San Francisco but all cities Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Langs film Metropolis  and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward See for example Allen Ginsberg Howl Original Draft Facsimile Transcript  Variant Versions ed Barry Miles New York Harper  xx Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of Howl which can be seen in the cited pages Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control including the conformist society of postxxWorld War II America focused on material gain which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms n n He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us the decision to defy socially created systems of controlxxand therefore go against Molochxxis a form of selfdestruction Many of the characters Ginsberg references in Howl such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle The personal aspects of Howl are perhaps as important as the political aspects Carl Solomon the prime example of a best mind destroyed by defying society is associated with Ginsbergs schizophrenic mother the line with mother finally  fucked comes after a long section about Carl Solomon and in Part III Ginsberg says Im with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write Howl was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly He dealt with it directly with s Kaddish which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting possibly due to its associations with Thomas Merton n  n n Inspiration from mentors and idolsn Ginsbergs poetry was strongly influenced by Modernism most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams Romanticism specifically William Blake and John Keats the beat and cadence of jazz specifically that of bop musicians such as Charlie Parker and his Kagyu Buddhist practice and Jewish background He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca The power of Ginsbergs verse its searching probing focus its long and lilting lines as well as its New World exuberance all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed Ginsberg Allen Spontaneous Mind Selected Interviews xx Harper Perennial  ISBN  n n He corresponded with William Carlos Williams who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem Paterson about the industrial city near his home After attending a reading by Williams Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like thee Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg In this mode perfection is basic and these poems are not perfect n n Though he disliked these early poems Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsbergs letter He included the letter in a later part of Paterson He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American From Williams Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images in line with Williams own motto No ideas but in things Studying Williams style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose colloquial free verse style Early breakthrough poems include Bricklayers Lunch Hour and Dream Record n n Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud To Have Done with the Judgement of God and Van Gogh The Man Suicided by Society and Jean Genet Our Lady of the Flowers Philip Lamantia introduced him to other Surrealists and Surrealism continued to be an influence for example sections of Kaddish were inspired by Andr Bretons Free Union Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of Howl and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as Jubilate Agno Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences such as Franz Kafka Herman Melville Fyodor Dostoevsky Edgar Allan Poe and even Emily Dickinson n n Ginsberg also made an intense study of haiku and the paintings of Paul Czanne from which he adapted a concept important to his work which he called the Eyeball Kick He noticed in viewing Czannes paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color the eye would spasm or kick Likewise he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry putting together two starkly dissimilar images something weak with something strong an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture something holy with something unholy The example Ginsberg most often used was hydrogen jukebox which later became the title of a song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsbergs poems Another example is Ginsbergs observation on Bob Dylan during Dylans hectic and intense  electricguitar tour fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines opiates alcohol and psychedelics as a Dexedrine Clown The phrases eyeball kick and hydrogen jukebox both show up in Howl as well as a direct quote from Czanne Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus n n Style and techniquen From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friendsxxnot to mention his own experimentsxxGinsberg developed an individualistic style thats easily identified as Ginsbergian TV interview  Hedwig Gorski and Robert Creeley discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry Special Robert Creeley issue Turkey Howl came out during a potentially hostile literary environment less welcoming to nontraditional free verse poetry there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by New Criticism Consequently Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long free verse lines often citing Whitmans free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor Ginsberg claimed Whitmans long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form n n Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality Though some critics like Diana Trilling have pointed to Ginsbergs occasional use of meter for example the anapest of who came back to Denver and waited in vain Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the natural poetic voice n n Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally Like Williams Ginsbergs line breaks were often determined by breath one line in Howl for example should be read in one breath Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breathsn n Many of Ginsbergs early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora repetition of a fixed base for example who in Howl America in America and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsbergs style He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence he did not yet trust free flight In the s after employing it in some sections of Kaddish caw for example he for the most part abandoned the anaphoric form n n Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems In the original draft of Howl each line is in a stepped triadic format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams But he abandoned the stepped triadic when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America Howl and Kaddish arguably his two most important poems are both organized as an inverted pyramid with larger sections leading to smaller sections In America he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines n n In Howl and in his other poetry Ginsberg drew inspiration from the epic free verse style of the thcentury American poet Walt Whitman see Ginsberg Deliberate Prose pp xx Both wrote passionately about the promise and betrayal of American democracy the central importance of erotic experience and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence J D McClatchy editor of the Yale Review called Ginsberg the

closed fieldn n In abstract algebra an algebraically closed field F contains a root for every nonconstant polynomial in F the ring of polynomials in the variable x with coefficients in Fn n Examplesn As an example the field of real numbers is not algebraically closed because the polynomial equation x     has no solution in real numbers even though all its coefficients  and  are real The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed in particular the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed Also no finite field F is algebraically closed because if a a x an are the elements of F then the polynomial x minus ax minus a  x minus an  n has no zero in F By contrast the fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of complex algebraic numbersn n Equivalent propertiesn Given a field F the assertion xxcF is algebraically closedxxd is equivalent to other assertionsn n The only irreducible polynomials are those of degree onen The field F is algebraically closed if and only if the only irreducible polynomials in the polynomial ring F are those of degree onen n The assertion xxcthe polynomials of degree one are irreduciblexxd is trivially true for any field If F is algebraically closed and px is an irreducible polynomial of F then it has some root a and therefore px is a multiple of x minus a Since px is irreducible this means that px  kx minus a for some k xx F   On the other hand if F is not algebraically closed then there is some nonconstant polynomial px in F without roots in F Let qx be some irreducible factor of px Since px has no roots in F qx also has no roots in F Therefore qx has degree greater than one since every first degree polynomial has one root in Fn n Every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomialsn The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial px of degree n x  with coefficients in F splits into linear factors In other words there are elements k x x x xn of the field F such that px  kx minus xx minus x  x minus xnn n If F has this property then clearly every nonconstant polynomial in F has some root in F in other words F is algebraically closed On the other hand that the property stated here holds for F if F is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that for any field K any polynomial in K can be written as a product of irreducible polynomialsn n Polynomials of prime degree have rootsn J Shipman showed in  that if every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F then every nonconstant polynomial has a root in F thus F is algebraically closedn n The field has no proper algebraic extensionn The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extensionn n If F has no proper algebraic extension let px be some irreducible polynomial in F Then the quotient of F modulo the ideal generated by px is an algebraic extension of F whose degree is equal to the degree of px Since it is not a proper extension its degree is  and therefore the degree of px is n n On the other hand if F has some proper algebraic extension K then the minimal polynomial of an element in K  F is irreducible and its degree is greater than n n The field has no proper finite extensionn The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite algebraic extension because if within the previous proof the word xxcalgebraicxxd is replaced by the word xxcfinitexxd then the proof is still validn n Every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvectorn The field F is algebraically closed if and only if for each natural number n every linear map from Fn into itself has some eigenvectorn n An endomorphism of Fn has an eigenvector if and only if its characteristic polynomial has some root Therefore when F is algebraically closed every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector On the other hand if every endomorphism of Fn has an eigenvector let px be an element of F Dividing by its leading coefficient we get another polynomial qx which has roots if and only if px has roots But if qx  xn  an minus xn minus    a then qx is the characteristic polynomial of the companion matrixn n n Decomposition of rational expressionsn The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every rational function in one variable x with coefficients in F can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form ax minus bn where n is a natural number and a and b are elements of Fn n If F is algebraically closed then since the irreducible polynomials in F are all of degree  the property stated above holds by the theorem on partial fraction decompositionn n On the other hand suppose that the property stated above holds for the field F Let px be an irreducible element in F Then the rational function p can be written as the sum of a polynomial function q with rational functions of the form ax minus bn Therefore the rational expressionn n can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials Since px is irreducible it must divide this product and therefore it must also be a first degree polynomialn n Relatively prime polynomials and rootsn For any field F if two polynomials pxqx xx F are relatively prime then they do not have a common root for if a xx F was a common root then px and qx would both be multiples of x minus a and therefore they would not be relatively prime The fields for which the reverse implication holds that is the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime are precisely the algebraically closed fieldsn n If the field F is algebraically closed let px and qx be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let rx be their greatest common divisor Then since rx is not constant it will have some root a which will be then a common root of px and qxn n If F is not algebraically closed let px be a polynomial whose degree is at least  without roots Then px and px are not relatively prime but they have no common roots since none of them has rootsn n Other propertiesn If F is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number then F contains all nth roots of unity because these are by definition the n not necessarily distinct zeroes of the polynomial xn minus  A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed The converse is not true Even assuming that every polynomial of the form xn minus a splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closedn n If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of firstorder logic is true for an algebraically closed field then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same characteristic Furthermore if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic  then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic  but there is some natural number N such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic p when p gt N See subsections Rings and fields and Properties of mathematical theories in  of J Barwises An introduction to firstorder logic n n Every field F has some extension which is algebraically closed Among all such extensions there is one and up to isomorphism but not unique isomorphism only one which is an algebraic extension of F See Langs Algebra VII or van der Waerdens Algebra I  it is called the algebraic closure of Fn n The theory of algebraically closed fields has quantifier eliminationn n Notesn

champion from  to  when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from  to  before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in  He held the title until  when he resigned his title in protest against FIDEs new world championship rules For his decadeslong standing among the worlds elite Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all timen n His tournament successes include over  firstplace finishes However in his  book My Best Games Karpov says he played some  tournaments and matches and won more than  He had a peak Elo rating of  and his  total months at world number one is second alltime behind only Garry Kasparov since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in n n Since  he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes such as advocating the use of iodised salt Unicef website On December   Karpov supported httpvotedumagovruvote the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the USn n Early lifen Karpov was born on May   at Zlatoust in the Urals region of the former Soviet Union and learned to play chess at the age of four His early rise in chess was swift as he became a Candidate Master by age eleven At twelve he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinniks prestigious

another group of people or the other alternative that no single person has full ownership over ones self Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic ie a just natural law that can govern all people independent of place and time The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is selfownership which he believes is both axiomatic and universal Rothbard

police courts and military others however might give further allowance for other government programs In contrast anarchocapitalists reject any level of state intervention defining the state as a coercive monopoly and as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism n n Some

Voluntary any action not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by any human agency n n This is the root of anarchocapitalist property rights and where they differ from collectivist forms of anarchism such as anarchocommunism where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed according to need Anarchocapitalists advocate individual or joint ie private ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual needs or does not need As Rothbard says if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive then he has the right to own the product that he has made After property is transformed through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift forced transfers are considered illegitimate Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any neverbefore used resources including land and by improving or otherwise using it own it with the same absolute right as his own body According to Rothbard property can only come about through labor therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it it is only by using land xx by mixing ones labor with it xx that original appropriation is legitimized Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be Rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the persons property for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource it remains his owned land His labor has been

and Property Right that any identifiable owner the original victim of theft or his heir must be accorded his property In the case of slavery Rothbard says that in many cases the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified and the reparations can become highly specific indeed He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the homestead principle If property is held by the state Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves and should be liberated as quickly as possible For example he proposes that State universities be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally private property if it is the result of stateinitiated force such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies He proposes that businesses who receive at least  of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers He says What we libertarians object to then is not government per se but crime what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles what we are for is not

Rothbard argues that patents are coercive monopolistic privileges granted by the state and says they would not exist in a free society because they prohibit individuals from independently coming up with the same invention He also argued that copyrights are in some situations compatible with a free society His argument is that when a copyright notice is on a piece of literary work this is a

points out that corporations would exist in a free society as they are simply the pooling of capital He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital On the purely free market such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation n n Corporations created in this way would not however be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising noncontractually such as

special privilege Rothbard Murray N  Man Economy  State with Power and Market Misesorg n n There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarchocapitalism Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in inalienable human rights and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will which would for instance prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured slavery Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract Nozick Robert  Anarchy State and Utopia n n Included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others Unlike anarchocommunists anarchocapitalists

similar example noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees and customers lives and safety in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the tellers call for help But the robbers loss of reputation would be even more damaging Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to

question of whether anarchocapitalist society is justified on deontological or consequentialist ethics or both Naturallaw anarchocapitalism as advocated by Rothbard holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law Some other anarchocapitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights but instead present economic justifications for a freemarket capitalist society Such a latter approach has been offered by David D Friedman in The Machinery of Freedom Tame Chris R October  The Chicago School Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties Economic Affairs p  Also unlike other anarchocapitalists most notably Rothbard Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on market failure but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions see government failure to compare the net result Nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a normative benchmark n n Kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since in the absence of the state sovereign individuals will make their own decisions about morality and will be held accountable via tort and contract law Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace For him the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form n n Anarchocapitalism

redistribution of private property etc In short while granting that certain noncoercive hierarchies will exist under an anarchocapitalist system they will have no real authority except over their own property a worker existing within such a hierarchy answerable to management bosses etc is free at all times to abandon this voluntary hierarchy and  create an organization within which heshe is at or somewhere near the top of the hierarchy entrepreneurship  join an existing hierarchy wherein heshe will likely be lower in the scheme of things or  abandon these hierarchies altogether and joinform a nonhierarchical association such as a cooperative commune etc Since there will be no taxes such cooperative organizations labour unions communes voluntary socialist associations wherein the product of the labour and of the capital goods of those who join which they were able to peaceably acquire would be shared amongst all who joined etc would under anarchocapitalism enjoy the freedom to do as they please provided of course that they set up their operation on their own xx or unowned xx property in other words so long as they do so without forcen n According to this argument the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society cooperatives nonprofit organizations which would just as today be funded by individuals for their existence businesses etc in short a free market does not equal the end of civil society which continues to be a critique of anarchocapitalism Moreover anarchocapitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists and others argue that the application of socalled leftist anarchist ideals would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it Some also argue that human beings are motivated primarily by the fulfillment of their own needs and wants Thus to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital which could result in further fulfillment of human desires there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and reallocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state The difference between such an arrangement and an anarchocapitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarchocapitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively egalitariananarchist system n n Anarchocapitalism and Austrian economicsn n The Austrian School of economics argued against the viability of socialism and centrally planned economic policy Eugen von BhmBawerk a colleague of Austrian school founder Carl Menger wrote one of the first critiques of socialism in his treatise The Exploitation Theory of SocialismCommunism Later Friedrich von Hayek wrote The Road to Serfdom which states that a command economy lacks the information function of market prices and that central authority over the economy leads to totalitarianism Another Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises wrote Human Action an early exposition of the method he called Praxeologyn Murray Rothbard xxn Murray Rothbard a student of Mises attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism He wrote his first paper advocating private property anarchism in  and later came up with the alternative name anarchocapitalism He was probably the first to use libertarian in its current US procapitalist sense His academic training was in economics but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy When young he considered himself part of the Old Right an antistatist and antiinterventionist branch of the Republican party In the late s he was briefly involved with Ayn Rand but later had a falling out When interventionist cold warriors of the National Review such as William F Buckley Jr gained influence in the Republican party in the s Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with leftwing antiwar groups He believed that the cold warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives especially with respect to Trotskyist theory Rothbard Murray N

Classical liberalism is the primary influence with the longest history on anarchocapitalist theory Classical liberals have had two main themes since John Locke first expounded the philosophy the liberty of man and limitations of state power The liberty of man was expressed in terms of natural rights while limiting the state was based for Locke on a consent theoryn n In the th century classical liberals led the attack against statism One notable was Frdric Bastiat The Law who wrote The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else Henry David Thoreau wrote I heartily accept the motto That government is best which governs least and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically Carried out it finally amounts to this which also I believe That government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have Thoreau Henry David  Civil Disobedience n n The early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations The normative core of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of laissezfaire a spontaneous order of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants Razeen Sally Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order Studies in Theory and Intellectual History Routledge UK ISBN   p  Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a taxfunded protector So they advocated what may be seen as classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was Frances Jakob Mauvillon in the th century Later in the s Julius Faucher and Gustave de Molinari advocated the samen n Molinari in his essay The Production of Security argued No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity Molinari and this new type of antistate liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics Historian and libertarian Ralph Raico

Libertarian Studies  The SpoonerTucker Doctrine An Economists View Lysander Spooner and Benjamin T Tucker were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy However he thought they had a faulty understanding of economics The th century individualists had a labor theory of value as influenced by the classical economists but Rothbard was a student of Austrian Economics which does not agree with the labor theory of value So Rothbard sought to meld thcentury American individualists advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics There is in the body of thought known as Austrian economics a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market and of the consequences of government intervention in that market which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung The SpoonerTucker Doctrine An Economists View Journal of Libertarian Studies vol  no  p    Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to itn n Rothbard disagreed with this as he explains in The SpoonerTucker Doctrine An Economists View He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase because he says that the money supply in a free market would be selfregulating If it were not then inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place Secondly he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated Also Tucker held a labor theory of value As a result he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or usury was taking place As he explains in State Socialism and Anarchism his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses which would in turn raise demand for labor This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay Again as a neoclassical economist Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory He believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to marginal utility rather than to labor amounts in free market And he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much others subjectively value their labor or what that labor produces even if it means people laboring the same amount receive different incomesn n Benjamin Tucker opposed vast concentrations of wealth which he believed were made possible by government intervention and state protected monopolies He believed the most dangerous state intervention was the requirement that individuals obtain charters in order to operate banks and what he believed to be the illegality of issuing private money which he believed caused capital to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few which he called the banking monopoly He believed anyone should be able to engage in banking that wished without requiring state permission and issue private money Though he was supporter of laissezfaire late in life he said that State intervention had allowed some extreme concentrations of resources to such a degree that even if laissezfaire were instituted it would be too late for competition to be able to release those resources he gave Standard Oil as an example Tucker Benjamin State Socialism and Anarchism Anarchocapitalists also oppose governmental restrictions on banking They like all Austrian economists believe that monopoly can only come about through government intervention thcentury American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner have long argued that monopoly on credit and land interferes with the functioning of a free market economyn n Although anarchocapitalists disagree on the critical topics of profit social egalitarianism and the proper scope of private property both schools of thought agree on other issues Of particular importance to anarchocapitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of sovereignty of the individual a market economy and the opposition to collectivism A defining point that they agree on is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the State Tucker said efense is a service like any other service that it is labor both useful and desired and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production that competition prevailing patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State and that the State like almost all monopolists charges exorbitant prices Tucker Benjamin Instead of a Book  n n Since anarchocapitalists disagree with Tuckers labor theory of value they disagree that free market competition would cause protection or anything else to be provided at cost Like the thcentury American individualist anarchists such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner anarchocapitalists believe that land may be originally appropriated by and only by occupation or use however most American individualists of the th century believed it must continually be in use to retain title Lysander Spooner was an exception from those who believed in the occupation and use theory and believed in full private property rights in land like Rothbard

Clouds Alan Sommerstein Penguin Books  page  was a comic playwright of ancient Athens Eleven of his thirty plays survive virtually complete These together with fragments of some of his other plays provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy and they are used to define the genre Aristophanes Clouds KJDover ed Oxford University Press  Intro page X Also known as the Father of Comedy Aristophanes in Performance  BCAD Peace Birds and Frogs Edith Hall and Amanda Wrigley Legenda Oxford  page  and the Prince of Ancient Comedy Character Sketches of Romance Fiction and the Drama Vol  Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author Barrett  page  His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries Plato The Apology translated by Benjamin Jowett section  Apology Greek text edited J Burnet section c singled out Aristophanes play The Clouds as slander that contributed to the trial and subsequent condemning to death of Socrates although other satirical playwrights Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds Alan Sommerstein Penguin Books  p had also caricatured the philosopher His second play The Babylonians now lost was denounced by the demagogue Cleon as a slander against the Athenian polis It is possible that the case was argued in court but details of the trial are not recorded and Aristophanes caricatured Cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays especially The Knights the first of many plays that he directed himself In my opinion he says through the Chorus in that play the authordirector of comedies has the hardest job of all  Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FWHall and WMGeldart eds Oxford Classical Texts Knights ln  n n Biographyn Theatre of Dionysus Athens xx in Aristophanes time the audience probably sat on wooden benches with earth foundations Barrett  p n Less is known about Aristophanes than about his plays In fact his plays are the main source of information about him It was conventional in Old Comedy for the Chorus to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the parabasis and thus some biographical facts can be got straight from the horses mouth so to speak However these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life Greek Comedy and Ideology David Konstan Oxford University Press US  page  He was a comic poet in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of teacher didaskalos and though this specifically referred to his training of the Chorus in rehearsal it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues Aristophanes The Clouds KJDover Oxford University Press  Intro page XIV Aristophanes claimed to be writing for a clever and discerning audience Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FWHall and WMGeldart eds Oxford Classical TextsClouds  yet he also declared that other times would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FWHall and WMGeldart eds Oxford Classical TextsClouds  He sometimes boasts of his originality as a dramatist Wasps  Wikisource original Greek Clouds  Peace  yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in Athenian society He caricatured leading figures in the arts notably Euripides whose influence on his own work however he once begrudgingly acknowledged Barrett  p in politics especially the populist Cleon and in philosophyreligion where Socrates was the most obvious target Such caricatures seem to imply that Aristophanes was an oldfashioned conservative yet that view of him leads to contradictions Greek Society Antony Andrewes Pelican Books  pages  n n The writing of plays was a craft that could be handed down from father to son and it has been argued that Aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds AH Sommerstein ed Penguin Books  page footnote The plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens the Lenaia and City Dionysia where they were judged and awarded places relative to the works of other comic dramatists An elaborate series of lotteries designed to prevent prejudice and corruption reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five in number These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences Barrett  p yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences Barrett  p The theatres were certainly huge with seating for at least   at the Theatre of Dionysus The days program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded with three tragedies and a satyr play ahead of the comedy and it is possible that many of the poorer citizens typically the main supporters of demagogues like Cleon occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of a dominant group in an unrepresentative audience The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays Throughout most of Aristophanes career the Chorus was essential to a plays success and it was recruited and funded by a choregus a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the archons A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour but Aristophanes showed in The Knights that wealthy citizens could regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FWHall and WMGeldart eds Oxford Classical Texts The Knights lines  Thus the political conservatism of the plays might reflect the views of the wealthiest section of society on whose generosity comic dramatists depended for the success of their plays WRennie The Acharnians of Aristophanes Arnold publisher London  page  reproduced by Bibliolife n n When Aristophanes first play The Banqueters was produced Athens was an ambitious imperial power and The Peloponnesian War was only in its fourth year His plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation the victors at Marathon Wasps  Wikisource original Greek Knights  Acharnians Wikisource Greek text  yet they are not jingoistic and they are staunchly opposed to the war with Sparta The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently By the time his last play was produced around  BC Athens had been defeated in war its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from the political to the intellectual centre of Greece Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds AHSommerstein ed Penguin Books  pp  Aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period xx the structure of his plays evolves from Old Comedy until in his last surviving play Wealth II it more closely resembles New Comedy However it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations Barrett  p n n Aristophanes won second prize at the City Dionysia in  BC with his first play The Banqueters now lost He won first prize there with his next play The Babylonians also now lost It was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the City Dionysia and The Babylonians caused some embarrassment for the Athenian authorities since it depicted the cities of the Athenian League as slaves grinding at a mill Greek Drama P Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World JBoardman JGriffin O Murray eds Oxford University Press  page  Some influential citizens notably Cleon reviled the play as slander against the polis and possibly took legal action against the author The details of the trial are unrecorded but speaking through the hero of his third play The Acharnians staged at the Lenaia where there were few or no foreign dignitaries the poet carefully distinguishes between the polis and the real targets of his acerbic witn n  The Acharnians Wikisource lines  n n People among us and I dont mean the polisn Remember this xx I dont mean the polis n But wicked little men of a counterfeit kindn n Aristophanes repeatedly savages Cleon in his later plays But these satirical diatribes appear to have had no effect on Cleons political career xx a few weeks after the performance of The Knights a play full of antiCleon jokes Cleon was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals Barrett  p Cleon also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Aristophanes the caricatures of him continued up to and even beyond his deathn n In the absence of clear biographical facts about Aristophanes scholars make educated guesses based on interpretation of the language in the plays Inscriptions and summaries or comments by Hellenistic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues We know however from a combination of these sources DWelsh IG ii  Philonides and Aristophanes Banqueters Classical Quarterly   and especially from comments in The Knights Knights  and The Clouds Clouds  that Aristophanes first three plays were not directed by him xx they were instead directed by Callistratus and Philoneides Ian Storey General Introduction in Clouds Wasps Birds By Aristophanes Peter Meineck translator Hackett Publishing  page xiii an arrangement that seemed to suit Aristophanes since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well Philoneides for example later directed The Frogs and he was also credited perhaps wrongly with directing The Wasps MacDowell  p Aristophaness use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information since apparent selfreferences might have been made on behalf of his directors instead Thus for example a statement by the chorus in The Acharnians The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines  seems to indicate that the poet had a close personal association with the island of Aegina yet the terms poet poietes and director didaskalos are often interchangeable since dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Aristophanes or Callistratus Similarly the hero in The Acharnians complains about Cleon dragging me into court over last years play Acharnians Wikisource original Greek  but here again it is not clear if this was said on behalf of Aristophanes or Callistratus either of whom might have been prosecuted by Cleon WRennie The Acharnians of Aristophanes Edward Arnold London  page  reproduced by

doubt AristophanesClouds KJDover ed Oxford University Press  Intro page IX note  It purports to be a record of conversations at a dinner party at which both Aristophanes and Socrates are guests held

Symposium B Plato Vol Loeb Classical Library  page  and yet there is no indication of any illfeeling between Socrates and Aristophanes Platos Aristophanes is in fact a genial character and this has been interpreted as evidence of Platos own friendship with him Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds Alan Sommerstein ed Penguin Books  page their friendship appears to be corroborated by an epitaph for Aristophanes reputedly written by Plato in which the playwrights soul is compared to an eternal shrine for the Graces Barrett  p Plato was only a boy when the events in The Symposium are supposed to have occurred and it is possible that his Aristophanes is in fact based on a reading of the plays For example conversation among the guests turns to the subject of Love and Aristophanes explains his notion of it in terms of an amusing allegory a device he often uses in his plays He is represented as suffering an attack of hiccoughs and this might be a humorous reference to the crude physical jokes in his plays He tells the other guests that he is quite happy to be thought amusing but he is wary of appearing ridiculous The Symposium original Greek textsection b The

Benjamin Jowett trans section  n n Aristophanes the Poetn Muse reading Louvren The language in Aristophanes plays and in Old Comedy generally was valued by ancient commentators as a model of the Attic dialect The orator Quintilian believed that the charm and grandeur of the Attic dialect made Old Comedy an example for orators to study and follow and he considered it inferior in these respects only to the works of Homer The Orators Training Quintilian  cited in Barrett  p Quintilian   A revival of interest in the Attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of Aristophanes plays during the th and th centuries AD resulting in their survival today In Aristophanes plays the Attic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualitiesn n For Aristophanes contemporaries the works of Homer and Hesiod formed the cornerstone of Hellenes history and culture Thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satire Barrett  pp  Aristophanes was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references to other poets These include not only rival comic dramatists such as Eupolis and Hermippus Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FWHall and WMGeldart eds Oxford Classical Texts Clouds lines  and predecessors such as Magnes Crates and Cratinus Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FW Hall and WM Geldart eds Oxford Classical Texts Knights lines  but also tragedians notably Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides all three of whom are mentioned in eg The Frogs Aristophanes was the equal of these great tragedians in his subtle use of lyrics Barrett  p He appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of Euripides in particular so much so that the comic dramatist Cratinus labelled him a Euripidaristophanist addicted to hairsplitting niceties n n A full appreciation of Aristophanes plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill and of their different rhythms and associations MacDowell  p There were three broad poetic forms iambic dialogue tetrameter verses and lyrics Barrett  pp n n  Iambic dialogue Aristophanes achieves an effect resembling natural speech through the use of the iambic trimeter corresponding to the effects achieved by English poets such as Shakespeare using iambic pentameters His realistic use of the metre MacDowell  p makes it ideal for both dialogue and soliloquy as for instance in the prologue before the arrival of the Chorus when the audience is introduced to the main issues in the plot The Acharnians opens with these three lines by the hero Dikaiopolis rendered here in English as iambic pentametersn n How many are the things that vex my heartn Pleasures are few so very few xx just four n But stressful things are manysandthousandsandheaps Original Greek Wikisource The Acharnians lines  n n Here Aristophanes employs a frequent device arranging the syntax so that the final word in a line comes as a comic climax MacDowell  p The heros pleasures are so few he can number them  four but his causes for complaint are so many they beggar numerical description and he must invent his own word for them  literally sandhundredheaps here paraphrased manysandthousandsandheaps The use of invented compound words is another comic device frequently found in the plays MacDowell  p AristophanesLysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds Alan Sommerstein Penguin Classics  page  n n  Tetrameter catalectic verses These are long lines of anapests trochees or iambs where each line is ideally measured in four dipodes or pairs of feet used in various situations within each play such asn  formal debates or agons between characters typically in anapestic rhythmn  excited dialogue or heated argument typically trochaic rhythm the same as in early tragedyn  long speeches declaimed by the Chorus in parabases in either anapestic or trochaic rhythmsn  informal debates barely above the level of ordinary dialogue typically iambicn Anapestic rhythms are naturally jaunty as in many limericks and trochaic metre is suited to rapid delivery the word trochee is in fact derived from trechein to run as demonstrated for example by choruses who enter at speed often in aggressive mood LPE Parker The Songs of Aristophanes Oxford  p  However even though both these rhythms can seem to bowl along Barrett  p Aristophanes often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted metres adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument In an anapestic passage in The Frogs for instance the character Aeschylus presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god Dionysusn n AESIt was Orpheus singing who taught us religion and how wrong people are when they killn And we learned from Musaeus medicinal cures and the science of divinationn If its farming you want Hesiod

Pantocles xx yesterdayn He was marching his men up and down on parade when the crest of his helmet fell off Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FWHall and WMGeldart eds Oxford Classical Texts Frogs lines  n n The rhythm begins at a typical anapestic gallop slows down to consider the revered poets Hesiod and Homer then gallops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate Pantocles Such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audiences appetite for the next joken n  Lyrics Almost nothing is known about the music that accompanied Greek lyrics and the metre is often so varied and complex that it is difficult for modern readers or audiences to get a feel for the intended effects yet Aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity of his lyrics Some of the most memorable and haunting lyrics are dignified hymns set free of the comic action Greek Drama Peter Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World edited by J Boardman J Griffin and O Murray Oxford University Press  page  In the example below taken from The Wasps the lyric is merely a comic interlude and the rhythm is steadily trochaic The syntax in the original Greek is natural and unforced and it was probably accompanied by brisk and cheerful music gliding to a concluding pun at the expense of Amynias who is thought to have lost his fortune gambling MacDowell  p n n Though to myself I often seemn A bright chap and not awkwardn None comes close to Amyniasn Son of Sellos of the Bigwign Clan a man I once

destitute Many of the puns in the plays are based on words that are similar rather than identical and it has been observed that there could be more of them than scholars have yet been able to identify Barrett  p Others are based on double meanings Sometimes entire scenes are constructed on puns as in The Acharnians with the Megarian farmer and his pigs The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines  the Megaran farmer defies the Athenian embargo against Megaran trade and tries to trade his daughters disguised as pigs except pig was ancient slang for vagina Since the embargo against Megara was the pretext for the Peloponnesian War Aristophanes naturally concludes that this whole mess happened because of three cuntsn n It can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery particularly the use of similes metaphors and pictorial expressions In The Knights for example the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as parasols that open and close Aristophanis Comoediae Tomus  FW Hall and WM Geldart eds Oxford Classical Texts Knights lines  In The Frogs Aeschylus is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sandpit The Frogs lines  Some plays feature revelations of human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious in character such as the marriage of the hero Pisthetairos to Zeuss paramour in The Birds and

Penguin Classics  page  Developments were quite rapid and Aristotle could distinguish between old and new comedy by  BC Nichomachean Ethics a  The trend from Old Comedy to New Comedy saw a move away from highly topical concerns with real individuals and local issues towards generalized situations and stock characters This was partly due to the internationalization of cultural perspectives during

a complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches to humour and entertainment Clouds translated by P Meineck with introduction by IStorey Hackett Publishing  page VII In Aristophanes early plays the genre appears to have developed around a complex set of dramatic conventions and these were only gradually simplified and abandonedn n The City Dionysia and the Lenaia were celebrated in honour of Dionysus the god of wine and ecstasy Euripides play The Bacchae offers the best insight into th century ideas about this god Clouds P Meineck translator and I Storey Introduction Hackett Publishing  page VIII Old Comedy can be understood as a celebration of the exuberant sense of release inherent in his worship Clouds P Meineck translator and I Storey Introduction Hackett Publishing  page XIX It was more interested in finding targets for satire than in any kind of advocacy Greek Society Antony Andrewes Pelican Books  page  During the City Dionysia a statue of the god was brought to the theatre from a temple outside the city and it remained in the theatre throughout the festival overseeing the plays like a privileged member of the audience Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds ASommerstein Penguin Classics  page  In The Frogs the god appears also as a dramatic character and he enters the theatre ludicrously disguised as Hercules He observes to the audience that every time he is on hand to hear a joke from a comic dramatist like Phrynichus one of Aristophanes rivals he ages by more than a year Frogs Wikisource English translation  original Greek text lines  This scene opens the play and it is a reminder to the audience that nobody is above mockery in Old Comedy xx not even its patron god and its practitioners Gods artists politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate targets comedy was a kind of licensed buffoonery Greek Society Antony Andrewes Pelican Books  page  and there was no legal redress for anyone who was slandered in a play Aristophanes The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett Penguin Classics  page  There were certain limits to the scope of the satire but they are not easily defined Impiety could be punished in th century Athens but the absurdities implicit in the traditional religion were open to ridicule Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics  page  The polis was not allowed to be slandered but as stated in the biography section of this article that could depend on who was in the audience and which festival was involvedn n For convenience Old Comedy as represented by Aristophanes early plays is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics xx topicality festivity and complexity Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes plays However it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate sectionn n Topicalityn Old Comedys emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries xx see for example articles on The Knights The Wasps and Peace for lists of topical references The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athensn n  Individual masks All actors in classical Athens wore masks but whereas in tragedy and New Comedy these identified stereotypical characters in Old Comedy the masks were often caricatures of real people Perhaps Socrates attracted a lot of attention in Old Comedy because his face lent itself easily to caricature by maskmakers Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics  page  In The Knights we are told that the mask makers were too afraid to make a caricature of Cleon there represented as a Paphlagonian slave but we are assured that the audience is clever enough to identify him anyway Knights lines  n n  The real scene of action Since Old Comedy makes numerous references to people in the audience the theatre itself was the real scene of action and theatrical illusion was treated as something of a joke In The Acharnians for example The Pnyx is just a few steps from the heros front door and in Peace Olympia is separated from Athens by a few moments supposed flight on a dung beetle The audience is sometimes drawn or even dragged into the action When the hero in Peace returns to Athens from his flight to Olympia he tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the heavens and seen up close they look even worse Peace  In The Acharnians the hero confronts the archon basileus The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines  sitting in the front row and demands to be awarded first prize for a drinking competition which is a none too subtle way for Aristophanes to request first prize for the drama competitionn n  Selfmocking theatre Frequent parodying of tragedy is an aspect of Old Comedy that modern audiences find difficult to understand But the Lenaia and City Dionysia included performances of both comedies and tragedies and thus references to tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant to the original audience Greek Drama Peter Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World JBoardman J Griffin and O Murray eds Oxford University Press  page  The comic dramatist also poked fun at comic poets and he even ridiculed himself It is possible as indicated earlier that Aristophanes mocked his own baldness In The Clouds the Chorus compares him to an unwed young mother Clouds lines  and in The Acharnians the Chorus mockingly depicts him as Athens greatest weapon in the war against Sparta Acharnians lines  n n  Political theatre The Lenaia and City Dionysus were statesponsored religious festivals and though the latter was the more prestigious of the two both were occasions for official pomp and circumstance The ceremonies for the Lenaia were overseen by the archon basileus and by officials of the Eleusinian mysteries The City Dionysia was overseen by the archon eponymous and the priest of Dionysus Opening ceremonies for the City Dionysia featured in addition to the ceremonial arrival of the god a parade in full armour of the sons of warriors who died fighting for the polis and until the end of the Peloponnesian War a presentation of annual tribute from subject states AristophanesLysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds ASommerstein Penguin Classics  pages  Religious and political issues were topics that could hardly be ignored in such a setting and the plays often treat them quite seriously Even jokes can be serious when the topic is politics xx especially in wartime The butts of the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey on the gullibility of their fellow citizens including oraclemongers eg Knights lines  Birds lines  the exponents of new religious practices eg Clouds lines  Frogs lines  warprofiteers and political fanatics In The Acharnians for example Lamachus is represented as a crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared to the heros preparations for a dinner party Acharnians lines  lines Cleon emerges from numerous similes and metaphors in The Knights as a protean form of comic evil clinging to political power by every possible means for as long as he can yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking Poseidon and Athena Knights lines  and  and it ends with visions of a miraculously transformed Demos ie the morally reformed citizenry of Athens Knights lines  Imaginative visions of a return to peaceful activities resulting from peace with Sparta eg Peace lines  and a plea for leniency for citizens suspected of complicity in an oligarchic revolt Frogs lines  are other examples of a serious purpose behind the playsn n  Teasing and taunting A festival audience presented the comic dramatist with a wide range of targets not just political or religious ones xx anyone known to the audience could be mocked for any reason such as diseases physical deformities ugliness family misfortunes bad manners perversions dishonesty cowardice in battle and clumsiness Aristophanes Clouds KJ Dover ed Oxford University Press  pages XIIIXIV Foreigners a conspicuous presence in imperial Athens particularly at the City Dionysia often appear in the plays comically mispronouncing Attic words xx these include Spartans Lysistrata Scythians Thesmophoriazusae Persians Boeotians and Megarians The Acharniansn n Festivityn The Lenaia and City Dionysia were religious festivals but they resembled a gala rather than a church service Aristophanes Clouds KJ Dover Oxford University Press  page XV n n  Dirty jokes A relaxation in standards of behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and gods Greek Drama Peter Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World Oxford University Press  page  Old Comedy is rich in obscenities and the crude jokes are often very detailed as when the Chorus in The Acharnians places a curse on Antimachus The Acharnians Wikisource original Greek lines  a choregus accused of niggardly conduct wishing upon him a nighttime mugging as he returns home from some drunken party and envisioning him as he stoops down to pick up a rock in the darkness accidentally picking up a fresh turd instead He is then envisioned hurling the turd at his attacker missing and accidentally hitting Cratinus a lyric poet not admired by Aristophanes Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics pages  notes  This was particularly funny because the curse was sung or chanted in choreographed style by a Chorus of  grown men who were otherwise known to the audience as respectable citizensn n  The musical extravaganza The Chorus was vital to the success of a play in Old Comedy long after it had lost its relevance for tragedy Aristophanes The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett Penguin Classics  pages  Technically the competition in the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between choruses Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics page  In fact eight of Aristophanes eleven surviving plays are named after the Chorus In Aristophanes time the Chorus in tragedy was relatively small twelve members and its role had been reduced to that of an awkwardly placed commentator but in Old Comedy the Chorus was large numbering  it was actively involved in the plot its entry into the action was frequently spectacular its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes it was involved in choreographed skirmishes with the actors The Acharnians lines  Wikisource original Greek Knights lines  Wasps lines  Wikisource original Greek The expenditure on costumes training and maintenance of a Chorus was considerable Aristophanes The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett Penguin Classics  page  and perhaps many people in the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and music Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell ed Oxford University Press  page  The chorus gradually lost its significance as New Comedy began to developn n  Obvious costumes Consistent with the holiday spirit much of the humour in Old Comedy is slapstick buffoonery that doesnt require the audiences careful attention often relying on visual cues Actors playing male roles appear to have worn tights over grotesque padding with a prodigious leather phallus barely concealed by a short tunic Female characters were played by men but were easily recognized in long saffron tunics Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics page  Sometimes the visual cues are deliberately confused for comic effect as in The Frogs where Dionysus arrives on stage in a saffron tunic the buskin boots of a tragic actor and a lion skin cloak that usually characterized Heracles  an absurd outfit that provokes the character Heracles as no doubt it provoked the audience to guffaws of helpless mirth Frogs lines  n n  The farcical anticlimax The holiday spirit might also have been responsible for an aspect of the comic plot that can seem bewildering to modern audiences The major confrontation agon between the good and bad characters in a play is often resolved decisively in favour of the former long before the end of the play The rest of the play deals with farcical consequences in a succession of loosely connected scenes The farcical anticlimax has been explained in a variety of ways depending on the particular play In The Wasps for instance it has been thought to indicate a gradual change in the main characters perspective as the lessons of the agon are slowly absorbed Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell Oxford University Press  page  In The Acharnians it has been explained in terms of a unifying theme that underlies the episodes demonstrating the practical benefits that come with wisdom Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics pages  But the early release of dramatic tension is consistent with the holiday meanings in Old Comedy Aristophanes Oldandnew Comedy Kenneth JReckford UNC Press  page  and it allows the audience to relax in uncomplicated enjoyment of the spectacle the music jokes and celebrations that characterize the remainder of the play The celebration of the heros victory often concludes in a sexual conquest and sometimes it takes the form of a wedding thus providing the action with a joyous sense of closure Aristophanes The Frogs and Other Plays David Barrett Penguin Classics  pages  n n Complexityn The development of New Comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone Aristophanes D Slavitt and P Bovie eds University of Pennsylvania Press  page XIII Old Comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour even to the point of undermining the humour itself Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy MSSilk Oxford University Press  page  n n  Inclusive comedy Old Comedy provided a variety of entertainments for a diverse audience It accommodated a serious purpose light entertainment hauntingly beautiful lyrics the buffoonery of puns and invented words obscenities disciplined verse wildly absurd plots and a formal dramatic structuren n  Fantasy and absurdity Fantasy in Old Comedy is unrestricted and impossibilities are ignored Aristophanes Clouds KJDover Oxford University Press  page XIII Situations are developed logically to absurd conclusions an approach to humour that is echoed for instance in the works of Lewis Carroll and Eugne Ionesco the Theatre of the Absurd Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell Oxford University Press  page  The crazy costume worn by Dionysus in The Frogs is typical of an absurd result obtained on logical grounds xx he wears a womans saffroncoloured tunic because effeminacy is an aspect of his divinity buskin boots because he is interested in reviving the art of tragedy and a lion skin cape because like Heracles his mission leads him into Hades Absurdities develop logically from initial premises in a plot In The Knights for instance Cleons corrupt service to the people of Athens is originally depicted as a household relationship in which the slave dupes his master The introduction of a rival who is not a member of the household leads to an absurd shift in the metaphor so that Cleon and his rival become erastai competing for the affections of an eromenos hawkers of oracles competing for the attention of a credulous public athletes in a race for approval and orators competing for the popular voten n  The resourceful hero In Aristophanic comedy the hero is an independentminded and selfreliant individual He has something of the ingenuity of Homers Odysseus and much of the shrewdness of the farmer idealized in Hesiods Works and Days subjected to corrupt leaders and unreliable neighbours Typically he devises a complicated and highly fanciful escape from an intolerable situation Clouds Peter Meineck translator and Ian Storey Introduction Hackett Publishing  page VIII Thus Dikaiopolis in The Acharnians contrives a private peace treaty with the Spartans Bdelucleon in The Wasps turns his own house into a private law court in order to keep his juryaddicted father safely at home Trygaeus in Peace flies to Olympus on a giant dung beetle to obtain an end to the Peloponnesian War Pisthetairus in Birds sets off to establish his own colony and becomes instead the ruler of the bird kingdom and a rival to the godsn n  The resourceful cast The numerous surprising developments in an Aristophanic plot the changes in scene and the farcical comings and goings of minor characters towards the end of a play were managed according to theatrical convention with only three principal actors a fourth actor often the leader of the chorus was permitted to deliver short speeches Aristophanes The Frogs and other Plays David Barrett ed Penguin Classics  page  Songs and addresses to the audience by the Chorus gave the actors hardly enough time offstage to draw breath and to prepare for changes in scenen n  Complex structure The action of an Aristophanic play obeyed a crazy logic of its own and yet it always unfolded within a formal dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play to another The different structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost in English translationsn n Dramatic structuren The structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as followsn  prologue  an introductory scene with a dialogue andor soliloquy addressed to the audience expressed in iambic trimeter and explaining the situation that is to be resolved in the playn  parodos  the arrival of the chorus dancing and singing sometimes followed by a choreographed skirmish with one or more actors often expressed in long lines of tetrametersn  symmetrical scenes  passages featuring songs and declaimed verses in long lines of tetrameters arranged symmetrically in two sections such that each half resembles the other in meter and line length the agon and parabasis can be considered specific instances of symmetrical scenesn  parabasis  verses through which the Chorus addresses the audience directly firstly in the middle of the play and again near the end see the section below Parabasisn  agon  a formal debate that decides the outcome of the play typically in anapestic tetrameter though iambs are sometimes used to delineate inferior arguments AristophanesWasps D MacDowell ed Oxford University Press  page  note  n  episodes  sections of dialogue in iambic trimeter often in a succession of scenes featuring minor characters towards the end of a playn  songs strophesantistrophes or odesantodes  often in symmetrical pairs where each half has the same meter and number of lines as the other used as transitions between other structural elements or between scenes while actors change costume and often commenting on the actionn  exodus  the departure of the Chorus and the actors in song and dance celebrating the heros victory and sometimes celebrating a symbolic marriagen The rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needs Aristophanes Lysistrata The Acharnians The Clouds A Sommerstein Penguin Classics  page  In The Acharnians and Peace for example there is no formal agon whereas in The Clouds there are two agonsn n Parabasisn The parabasis is an address to the audience by the Chorus andor the leader of the Chorus while the actors are leaving or have left the stage The Chorus in this role speaks sometimes out of character as the authors mouthpiece and sometimes in character but very often it isnt easy to distinguish its two roles Generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes own understanding was less formal Aristophanes Wasps Dougles MacDowell Oxford University Press  page  The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis The early plays The Acharnians to The Birds are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within themn  kommation This is a brief prelude comprising short lines and often including a valediction to the departing actors such as Go rejoicingn  parabasis proper This is usually a defense of the authors work and it includes criticism of the audiences attitude It is declaimed in long lines of anapestic tetrameters Aristophanes himself refers to the parabasis proper only as anapestsn  pnigos Sometimes known as a choker it comprises a few short lines appended to the parabasis proper as a kind of rapid patter it has been suggested that some of the effects achieved in a pnigos can be heard in The Lord Chancellors Nightmare Song in act  of Gilbert and Sullivans Iolanthe Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell ed Oxford University Press  page  n  epirrhematic syzygies These are symmetrical scenes that mirror each other in meter and number of lines They form part of the first parabasis and they often comprise the entire second parabasis They are characterized by the following elementsn  strophe or ode These are lyrics in a variety of meters sung by the Chorus in the first parabasis as an invocation to the gods and as a comic interlude in the second parabasisn  epirrhema These are usually long lines of trochaic tetrameters Broadly political in their significance they were probably spoken by the leader of the Chorus in character Aristophanes Clouds KJ Dover ed Oxford University Press  page  n  antistrophe or antode These are songs that mirror the stropheode in meter length and functionn  antepirrhema This is another declaimed passage and it mirrors the epirrhema in meter length and functionn n The Wasps is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approach AristophanesWasps Douglas MMacDowell Oxford University Press  note  page  and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as followsn n n  Elements in The Wasps st parabasis nd parabasis n  kommation lines  Wikisource  n  parabasis proper lines   n  pnigos lines   n  strophe lines  lines  Wikisource n  epirrhema lines  lines  n  antistrophe lines  missing n  antepirrhema lines  lines  n n Textual corruption is probably the reason for the absence of the antistrophe in the second parabasis Aristophanes Wasps Douglas MacDowell ed Oxford University Press  pages  n However there are several variations from the ideal even within the early plays For example the parabasis proper in The Clouds lines  is composed in eupolidean meter rather

Euripides died near the end of the Peloponnesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so

Murray eds Oxford University Press  page  Indeed according to one ancient source Platonius cth Century AD one of Aristophaness last plays Aioliskon had neither a parabasis nor any choral lyrics making it a type of Middle Comedy while Kolakos anticipated all the elements of New Comedy including a rape and a recognition scene EWHandley Comedy in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature Greek

in Clouds that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his plays Clouds lines  Clouds was awarded third ie last place after its original performance and the text that has come down to the modern age was a subsequent draft that Aristophanes intended to be read rather than acted Aristophanes Clouds KJDover Oxford University Press  pages XXIXXXX The circulation of his

Schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist dedicated also to the rescue restoration and study of historic pipe organs With theological insight he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in J S Bachs religious music In  he astonished Widor by explaining figures and motifs in Bachs Chorale Preludes as painterlike tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based They were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas conceived visually Widor

effectively launched the th century Orgelbewegung which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principlesxxalthough this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went

organbuilders in several European countries he produced a very considered report Joy  pp xx Text of  Questionnaire and Report pp xx This provided the basis for the International Regulations for Organ Building He envisaged instruments in which the French lateromantic fullorgan sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic reed pipes and with the classical Alsace Silbermann organ resources and baroque flue pipes all in registers regulated by stops to access distinct voices in fugue or counterpoint capable of combination without loss of distinctness different voices singing

founded the Paris Bach Society a choir dedicated to performing JS Bachs music for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until  He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orfo Catalxa at Barcelona and often travelled there for that purpose He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bachs organ works with detailed analysis of each work in three languages English French German Schweitzer who insisted that the score should show Bachs notation with no additional markings wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues and Widor those for the Sonatas and

Passion Play In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of Saint Thomas from which he had just graduated and in  his appointment was made permanent He officiated at the wedding of Theodor Heuss later the first President of West Germany on  April  n n Since the mids Schweitzer had formed the inner resolve that it was needful for him as a Christian to repay to the world something for the happiness which it had given to him and he determined that he would pursue his younger interests until the age of thirty and then give himself to serving humanity with Jesus serving as his examplen n In  he published Geschichte der LebenJesuForschung History of LifeofJesus research This book which established his reputation was first translated into English by William Montgomery and published in  as The Quest of the Historical Jesus Under this title the book became famous in the Englishspeaking world A second German edition was published in  containing theologically significant revisions and expansions but this revised edition did not appear in English until  This account of the editions of this work is disputed see talk page n n In The Quest Schweitzer reviewed all former work on the historical Jesus back to the late th century He showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous centurys findings He maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus own convictions which reflected late Jewish eschatology Schweitzer however writes n The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed He is a figure designed by rationalism endowed with life by liberalism and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb This image has not been destroyed from outside it has fallen to pieces  n n Sourcesn Schweitzer found many New Testament references to apparently show that stcentury Christians believed literally in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the Worlds ending within the lifetime of Jesuss original followers He noted that in the gospel of Mark Jesus speaks of a tribulation with his coming in the clouds with great power and glory St Mark and states when it will happen This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled St Matthew  or have taken place Luke  All these things shall come upon this generation Matthew  There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom Matthew  or until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power Mark  or till they see the kingdom of God Luke n n Schweitzer notes that St Paul apparently believed in the immediacy of the Second Coming of Jesus Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord  Thessalonians  St Paul spoke of the last times Brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none  Corinthians  God  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son Hebrews  Similarly in St Peter Christ  Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you  Peter  and But the end of all things is at hand  Peter  Surely I come quickly Revelation  Again note NT Wright ibidn n Schweitzer writes that modern Christians of many kinds deliberately ignore the urgent message so powerfully proclaimed by Jesus during the st century of an imminent end of the world Each new generation hopes to be the one to see the world destroyed another world coming and the saints governing a new earth Schweitzer concludes that the st century theology originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus is both incompatible with and far removed from those beliefs later made official by the Roman Emperor Constantine in  CEn n Aftermathn The publication of The Quest of the Historical Jesus effectively put a stop to decades of work on the Historical Jesus as a subdiscipline of New Testament studies what was later called the First Quest This work resumed however with the development of the socalled Second Quest among whose notable exponents was Rudolf Bultmanns student Ernst Ksemannn n Schweitzer established his reputation further as a New Testament scholar with other theological studies including The Psychiatric Study of Jesus  and his two studies of the apostle Paul Paul and his Interpreters and the more complete The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle  This examined the eschatological beliefs of Paul and through this the message of the New Testamentn n Medicinen At the age of  in  Schweitzer answered the call of The Society of the Evangelist Missions of Paris which was looking for a medical doctor However the committee of this French Missionary Society was not ready to accept his offer considering his Lutheran theology to be incorrect Seaver  p  He could easily have obtained a place in a German Evangelical mission but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties Amid a hail of protests from his friends family and colleagues he resigned his post and reentered the University as a student in a threeyear course towards the degree of a Doctorate in Medicine a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labor of healing rather than through the verbal process of preaching and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teachingn n Even in his study of medicine and through his clinical course Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopherscientist By extreme application and hard work he completed his studies successfully at the end of  His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus The Psychiatric Study of Jesus In June  he married Helene Bresslau daughter of the Jewish panGermanist historian Harry Bresslaun n In  now armed with a medical degree Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Societys mission at Lambarn on the Ogoou river in what is now Gabon in Africa then a French colony He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted By concerts and other fundraising he was ready to equip a small hospital From the Primeval Forest Chapter  In Spring  he and his wife and son Peter set off to establish a hospital

him for though Achebe seems to acknowledge that Schweitzers use of the word brother at all was for a European of the early th century an unusual expression of human solidarity between whites and blacks Schweitzer was more likely speaking in terms of modern civilization than of class relationship of man this would be consistent with his later statement that The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed Quoted by Lachlan Forrow in his Foreword to the  edition of African Notebook and his discussion of the modernization of primeval societies Later in life he became more convinced that modern civilization was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of moralityn n The journalist James Cameron visited Lambarn in  when Schweitzer was  and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people

skilled workers After three decades in Africa Schweitzer still depended on Europe for nurses By comparison his contemporary Sir Albert Cook in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Luganda n n Reverence for lifen n Schweitzer in n The keynote of Schweitzers personal philosophy which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind was the idea of Reverence for Life Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben He thought that Western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundationn n In the Preface to Civilization and Ethics  he argued that Western philosophy from Descartes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it But no such meaning was found and the rational lifeaffirming optimism of the Age of Enlightenment began to evaporate A rift opened between this worldview as material knowledge and the lifeview understood as Will expressed in the pessimist philosophies from Schopenhauer onward Scientific materialism advanced by Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics entirely an expression of the willtoliven n Schweitzer wrote True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness and this may be formulated as follows I am life which wills to live and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live Civilization and Ethics Chapter  p reprinted as A Schweitzer The Philosophy of Civilization Prometheus Books Buffalo  Chapter  In nature one form of life must always prey upon another However human consciousness holds an awareness of and sympathy for the will of other beings to live An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possiblen n Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it the willtolive constantly renews itself for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon Life and love are rooted in this same principle in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself Even so Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied not least in the European Middle Ages and in the Indian Brahminic philosophyn n For Schweitzer mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization the worldview must derive from the lifeview not viceversa Respect for life overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature In contemplation of the willtolife respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity Civilization and Ethics Preface and Chapter II The Problem of the Optimistic

Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD During  and  he resided in Britain delivering the Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh University and those on Religion in Modern Civilization at Oxford and London He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old Queens Hall in London These records did not satisfy him the instrument being too harsh In midDecember  he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All Hallows BarkingbytheTower London This fine  Harrison and Harrison organ was blitzed in the War cf W Kent The Lost Treasures of London Phoenix House  xx but was rebuilt in  see  Then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of Ste Aurlie in Strasbourg on a midth century organ by Johann Andreas Silbermann brother of Gottfried an organbuilder greatly revered by Bach which had been restored by the Lorraine organbuilder Frdric Hrpfer shortly before the First World War These recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in October  Seaver  pp xx n n The Schweitzer Techniquen Schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of Bachs music Known as The Schweitzer Technique it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as midside The midside sees a figure microphone pointed offaxis perpendicular to the sound source Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis bisecting the figure pattern The signal from the figure is multed panned hard left and right one of the signals being flipped out of polarity In the Schweitzer method the figure is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other The information that each capsule collects is unique unlike the identical outofpolarity information generated from the figure in a regular midside The onaxis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser The technique has since been used to record many modern instrumentsn n Columbia recordingsn Altogether his early

Schweitzern n n n Austrian Schooln n The Austrian School is a school of economic thought that is based on the analysis of the purposeful actions of individuals see methodological individualism Carl Menger Prinicples of Economics online at httpwwwmisesorgetextsmengerprinciplesasp Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Ludwig von Mises Human Action p  r Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction Referenced  It originated in lateth and earlyth century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger Eugen von BhmBawerk Friedrich von Wieser and others Joseph A Schumpeter History of economic analysis Oxford University Press  ISBN  Currentday economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries but their work is referred to as Austrian economicsn n Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value marginalism in price theory and the formulation of the economic calculation problem each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics n n Many economists are critical of the currentday Austrian School and consider its rejection of econometrics and aggregate macroeconomic analysis to be outside of mainstream economic theory or heterodox Austrians are likewise critical of mainstream economics Austrian Economics and the Mainstream View from the Boundary Roger E Backhouse Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late s it began to attract renewed academic and public interest starting in the s n n Methodologyn n The Austrian School theorises that the subjective choices of individuals underlie all economic phenomena Austrians seek to understand the observed economy by examining the social ramifications of such individual choice This approach termed methodological individualism differs significantly from many other schools of economic thought which have placed less importance on individual knowledge time expectation and other subjective factors and focused instead on aggregate variables equilibrium analysis and the consideration of societal groups rather than individuals n n Ludwig von Misesn In the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries many diverse approaches and theoretical orientations have developed among economists whose methodological lineage can be traced back to the early Austrian School For example in  Ludwig von Mises codified his version of the subjectivist approach which he called praxeology in a book published in English as Human Action Ludwig von Mises Nationalkonomie Geneva Union  p  Human Action Auburn Ala Mises Institute  p  In it Mises presented an extensive statement of his method and stated that praxeology could be used to deduce a priori theoretical economic truths Mises also argued against the use of probabilities in economic models According to Mises deductive economic thought experiment can yield conclusions which follow irrefutably from the underlying assumptions and could not be inferred from empirical observation or statistical analysis n n Since Mises time many but certainly not all Austrian thinkers have accepted his praxeological approach Some have adopted alternative methodologies Bruce J Caldwell Praxeology and its Critics an Appraisal History of Political Economy Fall   xx For example Fritz Machlup Friedrich Hayek and others did not take Mises strong a priori approach to economics Richard N Langlois FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF ECONOMICS TO THE ECONOMICS OF KNOWLEDGE FRITZ MACHLUP ON METHODOLOGY AND ON THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY Research in the History of Economic Thought and Methodology Volume  pp xx Prof Ludwig Lachmann a radical subjectivist also largely rejected Mises formulation of Praxeology in favor of the verstehende Methode interpretive method articulated by Max Weber n n Economist Paul A Samuelson has written that most economists believe that economic conclusions reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak According to Samuelson and economist Bryan Caplan Mises deductive methodology also embraced by Murray Rothbard and to a lesser extent by Mises student Israel Kirzner was not sufficient in and of itself Caplan has written that the Austrian challenge to the realism of neoclassical assumptions has helped work towards making those assumptions more plausible n n Starting in the th century various Austrians incorporated models and mathematics into their analysis of the economy Austrian economist Steven Horwitz argues that Austrian methodology is consistent with macroeconomics and that Austrian macroeconomics can be expressed in terms of microeconomic foundations Horwitz Steven Microfoundations and Macroeconomics An Austrian Perspective Routledge Austrian economist Roger Garrison argues that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of diagrammatic models httplibrarymisesorgbooksRogerWGarrisonAustrianMacroeconomicsADiagrammaticalExpositionpdf Garrison Roger Austrian

NeumannxxMorgenstern utility theorem in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior Neumann John von and Morgenstern Oskar Theory of Games and Economic Behavior Princeton NJ Princeton University Press  n n Fundamental tenetsn n Fritz Machlup listed the typical views of Austrian economic thinking n n Contributions to economic thoughtn n Opportunity costn n Friedrich von Wiesern The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser in the late th century Opportunity cost is the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative foregone that is not chosen It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone or group who has picked among several mutually exclusive choices This view is currently held by contemporary economists of all mainstream schools of thoughtn n Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics and has been described as expressing the basic relationship between scarcity and choice The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently n n Capital and interestn n Eugen von BhmBawerkn The Austrian theory of capital and interest was first developed by Eugen von BhmBawerk He stated that interest rates and profits are determined by two factors namely supply and demand in the market for final goods and time preference BhmBawerk Eugen Ritter von Kapital Und Kapitalizns Zweite Abteilung Positive Theorie des Kapitales  Translated as Capital and Interest II Positive Theory of Capital with appendices rendered as Further Essays on Capital and Interest httpwwweconliborglibraryEncbiosBohmBawerkhtml n n BhmBawerks theory was a response to Marxs labor theory of value and capital BhmBawerks theory attacked the viability of the labor theory of value in the light of the transformation problem His conception of interest countered Marxs exploitation theory Marx famously argued that capitalists exploit workers by paying them less than the fruits of their labor sell for BohmBawerk countered this claim by invoking the concept of time preference to demonstrate that everyone values present consumption more than future consumption and therefore that a difference between the smaller salary laborers are paid in the present and the greater price for which the goods they produce are later sold need not be exploitative n n BhmBawerks theory equates capital intensity with the degree of roundaboutness of production processes BhmBawerk also argued that the law of marginal utility necessarily implies the classical law of costs Some Austrian economists therefore entirely reject the notion that interest rates are affected by liquidity preferencen n Inflationn n Mises believed that money prices and wages will inevitably rise when the supply of money and bank credit is increased He therefore used the term inflation to mean an excessive increase of the money supply and not as is the common usage to refer to price inflation In Mises view inflation is the result of policies of the government or central bank which result in an increase in the circulating money supply Ludwig von Mises The Theory of Money and Credit ISBN  Mises wrote In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation an increase in the quantity of money in the broader sense of the term so as to include fiduciary media as well that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money again in the broader sense of the term so that a fall in the objective exchangevalue of money must occur The Theory of Money and Credit Mises   p  n n Economist Richard Timberlake criticized von Mises view that inflation must refer to an increase in the money supply Timberlake noted that economists since the time of John Stuart Mill have recognized the distinction between increases in the money stock and increases in the general level of money prices Timberlake stated that Mises view has repeatedly been proven false and that statistical measurement of the aggregate price level is necessary in order test the empirical validity of Mises theory n n Economist Paul Krugman has criticized Austrians views on inflation and the failure to test their views against empirical evidence In late  he pointed out that the monetary base had tripled in the previous three years but the average annual inflation rate was only  percent There was no devastating inflation as predicted by Austrians In late  he chided those who failed to let the evidence speak when it disproved the Austrian theory of inflation Krugman wrote If you believe that expanding credit will simply result in too much money chasing too few goods and hence a lot of inflation the failure of high inflation to materialize amounts to a decisive rejection of Austrian model Paul Krugman Varieties of Error  n n Economic calculation problemn n Friedrich Hayekn The economic calculation problem refers to a criticism of socialism which was first stated by Max Weber in  Mises subsequently discussed Webers idea with his student Friedrich Hayek who developed it in various works including The Road to Serfdom F A Hayek  The Nature and History of the Problem and The Present State of the Debate om in F A Hayek ed Collectivist Economic Planning pp xx xx The problem concerns the means by which resources are allocated and distributed in an economyn n Austrian theory emphasizes the organizing power of markets Hayek stated that market prices reflect information the totality of which is not known to any single individual which determines the allocation of resources in an economy Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and price discovery processes by which individuals act on their personal information Hayek argued that the decisions of socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge to make optimal decisions Those who agree with this criticism view it is a refutation of socialism and that it shows that it is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization The debate rose to prominence in the s and s and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as The Socialist Calculation Debate The socialist calculation debate n n Mises argued in a  article Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the means of production then no prices could be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not objects of exchange unlike final goods Therefore they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently This led him to write xthat rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth Economist Bryan Caplan has written that Misess has been criticized as overstating the strength of his case in describing socialism as impossible rather than that it may need to establish nonmarket institutions to deal with a source of inefficiency n n Business cyclesn n The Austrian theory of the business cycle ABCT focuses on banks issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations Although later elaborated by Hayek and others the theory was first set forth by von Mises who believed that banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes Mises stated that this led to a misallocation of resources which he called malinvestmentn n According to the theory malinvestment is induced by banks excessive and unsustainable expansion of credit to businesses Theory of Money and Credit Ludwig von Mises Part III Part IV Businesses borrow at unsustainably low interest rates and overinvest in capitalintensive production processes which in turn leads to a diversion of investment from consumer goods industries to capital goods industries Austrians contend that this shift is unsustainable and must eventually be reversed and that the readjustment process will be more violent and disruptive the longer the putative malinvestment in capital goods industries continuesn n According to the Austrian view the proportion of income allocated to consumption rather than saving is determined by the interest rate and peoples time preference which is the degree to which they prefer present to future satisfactions According to this view the pure interest rate is determined by the time preferences of the individuals in society If the market rate of interest offered by banks is set lower than this business borrowing will be excessive and will be allocated to malinvestment Theory of Money and Credit Ludwig von Mises Part II n n Newly extended credit thus malinvested will circulate from the business borrowers to the factors of production landowners capital goods producers and capital goods workers Austrians state that because individuals time preferences have not changed the market will tend to reestablish the old proportions between current and future production Depositors will tend to remove cash from the banking system and spend it not save it banks will then ask their borrowers for repayment and the excessive capital goods will be liquidated at lower prices to retire the nowunprofitable loans n n Role of government disputedn According to Mises central banks enable the commercial banks to fund loans at artificially low interest rates thereby inducing an unsustainable expansion of bank credit and impeding any subsequent contraction The Mystery of Banking Murray Rothbard  Theory of Money and Credit Ludwig von Mises Part III Part IV Americas Great Depression Murray Rothbard Friedrich Hayek disagreed Hayek did not favor laissezfaire in banking and said that a freely competitive banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and procyclical mimicking the effects which Rothbard attributed to central bank policy Hayek stated that the need for central banking control was inescapable n n Criticismn Most research regarding the theory finds that it is inconsistent with empirical evidence Economists such as Gordon Tullock Bryan Caplan Milton Friedman and Paul Krugman have said that they regard the theory as incorrect Austrian economist Ludwig Lachmann noted that the Austrian theory was rejected during the sn The promise of an Austrian theory of

to members of the German Historical school of economics who argued against the Austrians during the Methodenstreit methodology struggle in which the Austrians defended the role of theory in economics as distinct from the study or compilation of historical circumstance In  Menger published Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics which attacked the methods of the Historical school Gustav von Schmoller a leader of the Historical school responded with an unfavorable review coining the term Austrian School in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial Mengerxxs approach xx haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School Gustav Schmoller as merely xxcAustrianxxd the origin of that label xx led to a

Principles of Economics is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of marginal utility The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the s with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics While marginalism was generally influential there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Mengers work which came to be known as the xxcPsychological Schoolxxd xxcVienna Schoolxxd or xxcAustrian Schoolxxd

London School of Economics n Abraham Wald among othersn n Later Twentieth centuryn Israel Kirznern n By the mids most economists had embraced what they considered the important contributions of the early Austrians After World War II Austrian economics was disregarded or derided by most economists because it rejected mathematical and statistical methods in the study of economics Austrian economics and the mainstream View from the boundary by Roger E Backhouse  to view Fritz Machlup quoted Hayeks statement the greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought httpmisesorgdailyLudwigvonMisesAScholarWhoWouldNotCompromise Homage to Mises by Fritz Machlup  Mises student Israel Kirzner recalled that in  when Kirzner was pursuing his PhD there was no separate Austrian School as such When Kirzner was deciding which graduate school to attend Mises had advised him to accept an offer of admission at Johns Hopkins because it was a prestigious university and Fritz Machlup taught there n n After  Austrian economics can be divided into two schools of economic thought and the school split to some degree in the late th century One camp of Austrians exemplified by Mises regards neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed the other camp exemplified by Friedrich Hayek accepts a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy httpmisesorgjournalsqjaepdfqjaepdf n n Henry Hazlitt wrote economics columns and editorials for a number of publications and wrote many books on the topic of Austrian economics from the s to the s Hazlitts thinking was influenced by Mises His book Economics in One Lesson  sold over a million copies and he is also known for The Failure of the New Economics  a linebyline critique of John Maynard Keyness General Theory n n The reputation of the Austrian School rose in the lateth century due in part to the work of Israel Kirzner and Ludwig Lachmann at New York University and to renewed public awareness of the work of Hayek after he won the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Hayeks work was influential in the revival of laissezfaire thought in the th century n n Split among contemporary Austriansn According to economist Bryan Caplan by the late twentieth century a split had developed among those who selfidentify with the Austrian School One group building on the work of Hayek follows the broad framework of mainstream neoclassical economics including its use of mathematical models and general equilibrium and merely brings a critical perspective to mainstream methodology influenced by the Austrian notions such as the economic calculation problem and the independent role of logical reasoning in developing economic theory n n Murray Rothbardn A second group following Mises and Rothbard rejects the neoclassical theories of consumer and welfare economics dismisses empirical methods and mathematical and statistical models as inapplicable to economic science and asserts that economic theory went entirely astray in the twentieth century they offer the Misesian view as a radical alternative paradigm to mainstream theory Caplan wrote that if Mises and Rothbard are right then economics is wrong but if Hayek is right then mainstream economics merely needs to adjust its focus n n Economist Leland Yeager discussed the late twentieth century rift and referred to a discussion written by Murray Rothbard HansHermann Hoppe Joseph Salerno and others in which they attack and disparage Hayek To try to drive a wedge between Mises and Hayek on role of knowledge in economic calculation especially to the disparagement of Hayek is unfair to these two great men unfaithful to the history of economic thought and went on to call the rift subversive to economic analysis and the historical understanding of the fall of Eastern European communism n n In a  book published by the Mises Institute HansHermann Hoppe asserted that Murray Rothbard was the leader of the mainstream within Austrian Economics and contrasted Rothbard with Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek whom he identified as a British empiricist and an opponent of the thought of Mises and Rothbard Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and BhmBawerk through Mises to Rothbardn  n Economists of the Hayekian view are affiliated with the Cato Institute George Mason University and New York University among other institutions They include Peter Boettke Roger Garrison Steven Horwitz Peter Leeson and George Reisman Economists of the MisesRothbard view include Walter Block HansHermann Hoppe Jess Huerta de Soto and Robert P Murphy each of whom is associated with the Ludwig von Mises Institute and some of them also with academic

Guatemala Austrian economic ideas are also promoted by privately funded organizations such as the Mises Institute and the Cato Instituten n Criticismsn n General criticismsn Mainstream economists have argued that Austrians are often averse to the use of mathematics and statistics in economics n n Economist Bryan Caplan argues that many Austrians have not understood valid contributions of modern mainstream economics causing them to overstate their differences with it For example Murray Rothbard stated that he objected to the use of cardinal utility in microeconomic theory Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results are derived for any monotonic transformation of an ordinal utility function and do not entail cardinal utility The result is that conclusions about utility preferences hold no matter what values are assigned to themn n Economist Paul Krugman has stated that because Austrians do not use explicit models they are unaware of holes in their own thinking In February  Krugman further criticized Austrian School economists on their failure to revise their theory of inflation in light of their incorrect prophecies of governmentinduced inflation following the  financial crisis n n Economist Benjamin Klein has criticized the economic methodological work of Austrian economist Israel M Kirzner While praising Kirzner for highlighting shortcomings in traditional methodology Klein argued that Kirzner did not provide a viable alternative for economic methodology Klein Benjamin Book review Competition and Entrepreneurship by Israel M Kirzner University of Chicago Press  Journal of Political Economy Vol  No  xx December  Economist Tyler Cowen has written that Kirzners theory of entrepreneurship can ultimately be reduced to a neoclassical search model and is thus not in the radical subjectivist tradition of Austrian praxeology Cowen states that Kirzners entrepreneurs can be modeled in mainstream terms of search n n Economist Jeffrey Sachs argues that among developed countries those with high rates of taxation and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low rates of taxation and low social outlays He concludes that Friedrich Hayek was wrong to argue that high levels of government spending harms an economy and a generous socialwelfare state is not a road to serfdom but rather to fairness economic equality and international competitiveness Austrian economist Sudha Shenoy responded by arguing that countries with large public sectors have grown more slowly Sudha R Shenoy Are High Taxes the Basis of Freedom and Prosperity httpwwwthefreemanonlineorgfeaturedarehightaxesthebasisoffreedomandprosperity n n Methodologyn Critics generally argue that Austrian economics lacks scientific rigor and rejects scientific methods and the use of empirical data in modelling economic behavior Rules for the study of natural philosophy  from Book  The System of the World Some economists describe Austrian methodology as being a priori or nonempirical n  n n Economist Mark Blaug has criticized overreliance on methodological individualism arguing it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones and hence reject almost the whole of received macroeconomics n n Economist Thomas Mayer has stated that Austrians advocate a rejection of the scientific method which involves the development of empirically falsifiable theories Furthermore many supporters of using models of market behavior to analyze and test economic theory argue that economists have developed numerous experiments that elicit useful information about individual preferences n n Economist Leland Yeager rejects many favorite views of the Misesian group of Austrians in particular These include the specifics of their businesscycle theory ultrasubjectivism in value theory and particularly in interestrate theory their insistence on unidirectional causality rather than general interdependence and their fondness for methodological brooding pointless profundities and verbal gymnastics Provoked by mainstream abuses of mathematics including the frequent merely decorative and pretentious use of symbols some Austrians have wanted to ban mathematics from economics But is it not arrogant for someone who does not see how to use certain techniques constructively to suppose that no one else will ever see how either These Austrians should remember how in other contexts they emphasize the openness of the future and scope for novelty n n Business cycle theoryn n According to John Quiggin most economists believe that the Austrian business cycle theory is incorrect because of its incompleteness and other problems Economists such as Gottfried von Haberler Milton Friedman Gordon Tullock Bryan Caplan and Paul Krugman have argued that the theory is incorrectn n Theoretical objectionsn Some economists argue that Austrian business cycle theory requires bankers and investors to exhibit a kind of irrationality because the Austrian theory posits that investors will be fooled repeatedly by temporarily low interest rates into making unprofitable investment decisions Problems with Austrian Business Cycle Theory Bryan Caplan writes Why does Rothbard think businessmen are so incompetent at forecasting government policy He credits them with entrepreneurial foresight about all marketgenerated conditions but curiously finds them unable to forecast government policy or even to avoid falling prey to simple accounting illusions generated by inflation and deflation Particularly in interventionist economies it would seem that natural selection would weed out businesspeople with such a gigantic blind spot n n  n n Economist Paul Krugman has argued that the theory cannot explain changes in unemployment over the business cycle Austrian business cycle theory postulates that business cycles are caused by the misallocation of resources from consumption to investment during booms and out of investment during busts Krugman argues that because total spending is equal to total income in an economy the theory implies that the reallocation of resources during busts would increase employment in consumption industries whereas in reality spending declines in all sectors of an economy during recessions He also argues that according to the theory the initial booms would also cause resource reallocation which implies an increase in unemployment during booms as well n n In response historian David Gordon argues that Krugmans analysis misrepresents Austrian theory Gordon states unemployment as Austrians see matters stems mainly from rigid wage rates If workers accept a fall in wages liquidation of the boom is compatible with full employment Hangover Theory How Paul Krugman Has Misconceived Austrian Theory xx David Gordon xx Mises Daily Austrian economist Roger Garrison states that a false boom caused by artificially low interest rates would cause a boom in consumption goods as well as investment goods with a decrease in middle goods thus explaining the jump in unemployment at the end of a boom Garrison has also stated that capital allocated to investment goods cannot always be redeployed to create consumption goods n n Economist Jeffery Hummel is critical of Hayeks explanation of labor asymmetry in booms and busts He argues that Hayek makes peculiar assumptions about demand curves for labor in his explanation of how a decrease in investment spending creates unemployment He also argues that the labor asymmetry can be explained in terms of a change in real wages but this explanation fails to explain the business cycle in terms of resource allocation n n Milton Friedman objected to the policy implications of the theory stating the following in a  interviewn n I think the Austrian businesscycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm If you go back to the s which is a key point here you had the Austrians sitting in London Hayek and Lionel Robbins and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world Youxxve just got to let it cure itself You canxxt do anything about it You will only make it worse You have Rothbard saying it was a great mistake not to let the whole banking system collapse I think by encouraging that kind of donothing policy both in Britain and in the United States they did harm Interview in Barrons Magazine August   archived at Hoover Institution n n Empirical objectionsn Hummel argues that the Austrian explanation of the business cycle fails on empirical grounds In particular he notes that investment spending remained positive in all recessions where there are data except for the Great Depression He argues that this casts doubt on the notion that recessions are caused by a reallocation of resources from industrial production to consumption since he argues that the Austrian business cycle theory implies that net investment should be below zero during recessions In response Austrian economist Walter Block argues that the misallocation during booms does not preclude the possibility of demand increasing overall httpwwwreasonpaperscompdfrppdf n n In  economist Milton Friedman after examining the history of business cycles in the US concluded that The HayekMises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence It is I believe false He analyzed the issue using newer data in  and again reached the same conclusion n n Referring to Friedmans discussion of the business cycle Austrian economist Roger Garrison stated Friedmans empirical findings are broadly consistent with both Monetarist and Austrian views and goes on to argue that although Friedmans model describes the economys performance at the highest level of aggregation Austrian theory offers an insightful account of the market process that might underlie those aggregates Milton Friedman The Plucking Model of Business Fluctuations Revisited Economic Inquiry April  n n Principal worksn  Capital and Interest by

for those close to the skin include redness pain warmth and swelling that when pressed feels like it is fluid filled The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling Carbuncles and furuncles are types of abscess that often involves hair follicles with carbuncles being larger n n They are usually caused by a bacterial infection Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus Rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world Diagnosis is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear In abscesses around the anus computer tomography CT may be important to look for deeper infection n n Standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics in most people who are otherwise healthy A small amount of evidence supports not packing with gauze the cavity that remains after drainage Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increase the risk of the abscess returning Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient n n Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as  in this population In  in the United States  million people went to the emergency department for an abscess In Australia around  people were hospitalized in  for the disease n n Signs and symptomsn An abscessn The main symptoms and signs of an abscess are redness heat swelling pain and loss of function Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface where they may be superficial pustules boils or deep skin abscesses in the lungs brain teeth kidneys and tonsils Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death gangrene Abscesses in most parts of the body rarely heal themselves so prompt medical attention is indicated at the first suspicion of an abscessn An abscess could potentially be fatal although this is rare if it compresses vital structures such as the trachea in the context of a deep neck abscessn n If superficial abscesses may be fluctuant when palpated This is a wavelike motion which is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess n n Causesn Risk factors for abscess formation include intravenous drug use n n They are usually caused by a bacterial infection Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus n n Rarely parasites can causes abscesses and this is more common in the developing world Specific parasites known to do this include dracunculiasis and myiasis n n Perianal abscessn Surgery of the anal fistula to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery There is no evidence that fecal incontinence is a consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage n n Perianal abscesses can be seen in patients with for example inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns disease or diabetes Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area and then develops into an abscess This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the anus which grows larger and more painful with time Like other abscesses perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment such as an incision and debridement or lancingn n Differentialn Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include cellulitis a sebaceous cyst and necrotising fasciitis n n Pathophysiologyn An diagram of an abscessn An abscess is a defensive reaction of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the bodyn n The organisms or foreign materials kill the local cells resulting in the release of cytokines The cytokines trigger an inflammatory response which draws large numbers of white blood cells to the area and increases the regional blood flown n The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall or capsule that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures However such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus or from reaching the causative organism or foreign objectn n Diagnosisn thumbn Abscesses must be differentiated from empyemas which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavityn n For those with a history of intravenous drug use an Xray is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present In this population if there is also a fever present infectious endocarditis should be considered n n Treatmentn The standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics in most cases A small amount of evidence did not find benefit from packing the abscess with gauze n n Incision and drainagen n Abscess five days after incision and drainagen Abscess following curettagen The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause which may require their removal If foreign objects are not the cause a doctor will incise and drain the abscess and prescribe painkillers and possibly antibiotics n n Surgical drainage of the abscess eg lancing is usually indicated once the abscess has developed from a harder serous inflammation to a softer pus stagen n In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk it may be delayed or used as a last resort The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the respiratory tract Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscessn n  Antibiotics n Most people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses many sites of infection rapid disease progression the presence of cellulitis symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body or a health condition causing immunosuppression People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face hands or genitals then antibiotics may be indicated n n In those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment Staphylococcus aureus bacteria is a common cause and an antistaphylococcus antibiotic such as flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin is used The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address communityacquired methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA and in those cases traditional antibiotics may be ineffective Alternative antibiotics effective against communityacquired MRSA often include clindamycin doxycycline minocycline and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional antistaphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levelsn n Culturing the wound is not needed if standard followup care can be provided after the incision and drainage Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment n n Packingn In North America after drainage an abscess cavity is often packed perhaps with cloth in an attempt to protect the healing wound However evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence bring more rapid healing or lead to fewer physician visits n n Primary closuren Closing an abscess right after draining it rather than leaving it open appears to speed healing without increase the risk of the abscess returning This may not apply to anorectal abscesses While they heal faster there maybe a higher rate of recurrence than those left open n n Prognosisn Even without treatment they rarely result in death as they will naturally burst through the skin n n Epidemiologyn Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years Risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as  in this population In  in the United States  million people went to the emergency

of the area The Anasazi or Ancient Pueblo from CPLUHNA Northern Arizona University The Ancient Pueblo homeland centers on the Colorado Plateau but extends from central New Mexico on the east to southern Nevada on the west n n Areas of southern Nevada Utah and Colorado form a loose northern boundary while the southern edge is defined by the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers in Arizona and the Rio Puerco and Rio Grande in New Mexico Structures and other evidence of Ancient Pueblo culture has been found extending east onto the American Great Plains in areas near the Cimarron and Pecos rivers and in the Galisteo Basinn n Terrain and resources within this expansive region vary greatly The plateau regions have high elevations ranging from  to  ft Extensive horizontal mesas are capped by sedimentary formations and support woodlands of junipers pinon and ponderosa pines each favoring different elevations Wind and water erosion have created steepwalled canyons and sculpted windows and bridges out of the sandstone landscape In areas where resistant strata sedimentary rock layers such as sandstone or limestone overlie more easily eroded strata such as shale rock overhangs formed The Ancient Pueblo favored building under such overhangs for shelters and building sites n n All areas of the Ancient Pueblo homeland suffered from periods of drought and wind and water erosion Summer rains could be undependable and often arrived as destructive thunderstorms While the amount of winter snowfall varied greatly the Ancient Pueblo depended on the snow for most of their water Snow melt allowed the germination of seeds both wild and cultivated in the spring n n Where sandstone layers overlay shale snow melt could accumulate and create seeps and springs which the Ancient Pueblo used as water sources Snow also fed the smaller more predictable tributaries such as the Chinle Animas Jemez and Taos rivers The larger rivers were less important to the ancient culture as smaller streams were more easily diverted or controlled for irrigationn n Pueblo Bonito the largest of the Chacoan Great Houses stands at the foot of Chaco Canyons northern rimn n  Cultural characteristics n n The Ancient Pueblo culture is perhaps best known for the stone and earth dwellings built along cliff walls particularly during the Pueblo II and Pueblo III eras The bestpreserved examples of the stone dwellings are in National Parks USA such as Navajo National Monument Chaco Canyon or Chaco Culture National Historical Park Mesa Verde National Park Canyons of the Ancients National Monument Aztec Ruins National Monument Bandelier National Monument Hovenweep National Monument and Canyon de Chelly National Monument n n These villages called pueblos by Spanish settlers were often only accessible by rope or through rock climbing These astonishing building achievements had more modest beginnings The first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pithouse a common feature in the Basketmaker periodsn n Ancestral Puebloans are also known for their pottery In general pottery was used for cooking or storage in the region was unpainted gray either smooth or textured In n n Mimbres Bowl with rabbit c AD xxn n the northern or Anasazi portion of the Ancestral Pueblo world from about  to  CE the most common decorated pottery had black painted designs on white or light gray

ceremonial vessels while narrownecked jars may have been used for liquids Ware in the southern portion of the region particularly after  CE is characterized by heavier blackline decoration and the use of carbonbased colorants In northern New Mexico the local black on white tradition the Rio Grande white wares continued well after  CE n n Changes in pottery composition structure and decoration are signals of social change in the archaeological record This is particularly true as the peoples of the American Southwest began to leave their traditional homes and migrate south According to archaeologists Patricia Crown and Steadman Upham the appearance of the bright colors on Salada Polychromes in the th century may reflect religious or political alliances on a regional level Late th and th century pottery from central Arizona widely traded in the region has colors and designs which may derive from earlier ware by both Ancestral Pueblo and Mogollon peoples Cordell p  n n Tonto

crafted a unique architecture with planned community spaces The ancient population centers such as Chaco Canyon outside Crownpoint New Mexico Mesa Verde near Cortez Colorado and Bandelier National Monument near Los Alamos New Mexico for which the Ancestral Pueblo peoples are renowned consisted of apartmentlike complexes and structures made from stone adobe mud and other local material or were carved into the sides of canyon walls Each were influenced by themselves and design details from other cultures as far away as contemporary Mexico n n In their day these ancient towns and cities were usually multistoried and multipurposed buildings surrounding open plazas and viewsheds and were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Pueblo peoples These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadwaysn n Multistory dwellings at Bandelier Rock wall foundations and beam holes and cavates carved into volcanic tuff remain from upper floorsn n Constructed well before  CE these Ancestral Pueblo towns and villages in the Southwestern United States were located in various defensive positions for example on high steep mesas such as at Mesa Verde or presentday Acoma Pueblo called the Sky City in New Mexico Earlier than  CE progressing past the th century the population complexes were a major center of culture for the Ancient Pueblo Peoples In Chaco Canyon Chacoan developers quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances assembling  major complexes which remained the largest buildings in North America until the th century n n Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed with the Sun Dagger petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon beginning with a year drought in  n n  Great Houses n n Immense complexes known as Great Houses embodied worship at Chaco As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed the houses kept several core traits Most apparent is their sheer bulk complexes averaged more than  rooms each and some enclosed up to  rooms Individual rooms were substantial in size with higher ceilings than Ancestral Pueblo works of preceding periods They were wellplanned vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage rather than in increments n n Casa Rinconada Chaco Culture National Historical Park New Mexico n Doorways Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon New Mexicon n Houses generally faced the south

n One of the most notable aspects of Ancestral Puebloan infrastructure is at Chaco Canyon and is the Chaco Road a system of roads radiating out from many great house sites such as Pueblo Bonito Chetro Ketl and Una Vida and leading towards small outlier sites and natural features within and beyond the canyon limitsn n Through satellite images and ground investigations archaeologists have detected at least  main roads that together run for more than  miles ca  km and are more than  feet  m wide These were excavated into a smooth leveled surface in the bedrock or created through the removal of vegetation and soil The Ancestral Pueblo residents of Chaco Canyon cut large ramps and stairways into the cliff rock to connect the roadways on the ridgetops of the canyon to the sites on the valley bottomsn n The largest roads constructed at the same time as many of the great house sites between  and  CE are the Great North Road the South Road the Coyote Canyon Road the Chacra Face Road Ahshislepah Road Mexican Springs Road the West Road and the shorter PintadoChaco Road Simple structures like berms and walls are found sometimes aligned along the courses of the roads Also some tracts of the roads lead to natural features such as springs lakes mountain tops and pinnacles Chacoan Roads National Park Service Retrieved  June  n n The Great North Roadn The longest and most famous of these roads is the Great North Road The Great North Road originates from different routes close to Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl These roads converge at Pueblo Alto and from there lead north beyond the Canyon limits There are no communities along the roads course apart from small isolated structuresn n Archaeological interpretations of the Chaco road system are divided between an economic purpose and a symbolic ideological role linked to ancestral Puebloan beliefsn n The system was first discovered at the end of the th century and first excavated and studied in the s Archaeologists suggested that the roads main purpose was to transport local and exotic goods inside and outside the canyon Someone also suggested that these large roads were used to quickly move an army from the canyon to the outlier communities a purpose similar to the road systems known for the Roman empire This last scenario has long been discarded because of the lack of any evidence of a permanent armyn n The economic purpose of the Chaco road system is shown by the presence of luxury items at Pueblo Bonito and elsewhere in the canyon Items such as macaws turquoise marine shells and imported vessels prove the longdistance commercial relations Chaco had with other regions A further suggestion is that the widespread use of timber in Chacoan constructionsxxa resource not locally availablexxneeded a large and easy transportation system Through analysis of various strontium isotopes archaeologists have realized that much of the timber that composes Chacoan construction came from a number of distant mountain ranges indicative also of the Chaco Roads economic significance English Nathan B Julio L Betancourt Jeffrey S Dean andJay Quade Strontium isotopes reveal distant sources of architectural timber in Chaco Canyon New Mexico Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  Aug  Retrieved  June  n n  Ancient Religion and Road Building n Prehistoric roads and great houses in the San Juan Basin n Other archaeologists think instead that the main purpose of the road system was a religious one providing pathways for periodic pilgrimages and facilitating regional gatherings for seasonal ceremonies Furthermore considering that some of these roads seem to go nowhere experts suggest that they can be linkedxxespecially the Great North Roadxxto astronomical observations solstice marking and agricultural cyclesn n This religious explanation is supported by modern Pueblo beliefs about a North Road leading to their place of origin and along which the spirits of the dead travel According to modern pueblo people this road represents the connection to the shipapu the place of emergence of the ancestors or a dimensional doorway During their journey from the shipapu to the world of the living the spirits stop along the road and eat the food left for them by the livingn n Astronomy certainly played an important role in Chaco culture as it is visible in the northsouth axis alignment of many ceremonial structures The main buildings at Pueblo Bonito for example are arranged according to this direction and probably served as central places for ceremonial journeys across the landscapen n Sparse concentrations of ceramic fragments along the North Road have been related to some sort of ritual activities carried out along the roadway Isolated structures located on the roadsides as well as on top of the canyon cliffs and ridge crests have been interpreted as shrines related to these activitiesn n Finally features such as long linear grooves were cut into the bedrock along certain roads which do not seem to point to a specific direction It has been proposed that these were part of pilgrimage paths followed during ritual ceremoniesn n Archaeologists agree that the purpose of this road system may have changed through time and that the Chaco Road system probably functioned for both economic and ideological reasons Its significance for archaeology lies in the possibility to understand the rich and sophisticated cultural expression of Ancestral Pueblo societiesn n  Cliff Palace communities and design n Plan of entire Spruce Tree House from above cut

the cliff alcove in which it was built it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures defined as kivasn n Throughout the southwest Ancient Puebloan region and at Mesa Verde the best known site for these large number of well preserved cliff dwellings housing defensive and storage complexes were built in shallow caves and under rock overhangs along canyon walls The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone held together and plastered with adobe mortar n n Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde reflected a regionwide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close highly defensible quarters during the th centuryn n While much of the construction in these sites conforms to common Pueblo architectural forms including Kivas towers and pithouses the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations Mug House a typical cliff dwelling of the period was home to around  people who shared  small rooms and eight kivas built right up against each other and sharing many of their walls builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could and no areas were considered offlimits to construction n n Not all of the people in the region lived in cliff dwellings many colonized the canyon rims and slopes in multifamily structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled Decorative motifs for these sandstonemortar constructions both cliff dwellings and non included Tshaped windows and doors This has been taken by some archaeologists such as Stephen Lekson  as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chaco Canyon elite system which had seemingly collapsed around a

and regular rainfall patterns Studies of skeletal remains show that this growth was due to increased fertility rather than decreased mortality However this tenfold increase in population over the course of a few generations could not be achieved by increased birthrate alone likely it also involved migrations of peoples from surrounding areas Innovations such as pottery food storage and agriculture enabled this rapid growth Over several decades the Ancient Pueblo culture spread across the landscape n n Ancient Pueblo culture has been divided into three main areas or branches based on

Modern Pueblo oral traditions hold that the ancient Pueblo people originated from sipapu where they emerged from the underworld For unknown ages they were led by chiefs and guided by spirits as they
